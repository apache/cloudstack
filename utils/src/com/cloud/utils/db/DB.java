 * 
 * 3. Annotate methods that are inside a DAO but doesn't use
 *    the Transaction class.  Generally, these are methods
 *    that are utility methods for setting up searches.  In
 *    this case use @DB(txn=false) to annotate the method.
 *    While this is not required, it helps when you're debugging
 *    the code and it saves on method calls during runtime.
