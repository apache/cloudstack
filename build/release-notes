********************************************************************************             
             VMOps Cloud Stack Version 0.4
                            Release Notes
********************************************************************************

=================================
WHAT'S NEW :
=================================

* NIC bonding support for the Computing, Routing, and Storage nodes to take
advantage of the multiple NICS installed on the server.
* Maintenance Mode support for physical servers.  Administrators now have the
option to enable or disable maintenance mode on any physical servers.  Enabling
maintenance mode on a Routing or Computing node will result in the seamless live
migration of guest virtual machines into other physical servers within the same
zone before making the server available for maintenance.
* Introduction of a new user web interface for allowing user accounts to manage
their own virtual machines.  This new interface has a brand new look and feel,
allows for easier branding and customization, and is easier to incorporate into
existing web interfaces.
* Added support for the creation of Reseller Domains.  The Reseller Domain 
feature allows host providers to create resellers complete with their own
user base and administrators while using the same global computing resources
provided by the host provider.
* Added a new email alerting system that will now inform administrators of
events such as when physical servers are down or computing resources are 
passing a pre-configured threshold.
* Massive improvements to the existing Developer and Integration API.  Error
codes have now been added and existing API method names and parameters have been
made more consistent.  A JSON format can also now be optionally
returned in addition to the existing XML format.  Please read the new API
Reference documentation for more details on the changes.
* Billing records have now been changed to Usage records to provide data for
both billing integration and usage metering.  Price has been completely removed
from VMOps.  Instead we added ability to set your own display text for both 
service offering and templates.  You can now use this to set any text for the UI
to display.
* New virtual machines deployed will now generate a random password.  A reset
password is also now available both in the web user interface as well as the 
API.  We support both Linux and Windows OS based templates.
* Storage server is now a bare-bone installation and uses the new COMSTAR iSCSI 
stack for improved performance.  We recognized that while running the storage 
server as a virtual machine does allows for more hardware support, it severely 
impacts performance.  The list of compatible hardware can be found in the Open 
Solaris website.
* Added clustering support for the VMOps Management Server.  
* Added the ability to configure an additional storage ip address (separate 
subnet) for both Routing and Computing servers.  If a server is configured with 
an additional storage ip, all storage traffic will route through this subnet and
all network/internet traffic will route through the existing private network.
* Added concept of a user account.  VMOps supports multiple username for a
single user account.
* Created new installers for the VMOps MultiTenant Hypervisor and the VMOps
Storage.

=================================
KNOWN ISSUES :
=================================

* DomR is still counting internal network activities as part of the usage that
is being returned by the API.
* The reset password for virtual machine feature does not return an error if it
fails to successfully reset the password.
* VMOps installation scripts to not validate bad network configuration values.
* VNX Proxy Server does not handle rapid refreshes of web console proxy well.
* VNC Proxy Server at times do not return a thumbnail image.
* Rebooting a DomR instance will cause network traffic to not be collected.
* Associating new IP addresses should clean out existing LB or PF rules before
assigning it to a DomR instance.  
* The Usage parse engine needs to be split out from the VMOps Management Server
so that only a single instance of this can be running and does not affect
normal operations.
* Templates needs a way of specifying the minimum CPU and Memory requirements.
* createUser API method currently allows you to assign users to admin accounts.
* Installations of servers with more than 3 NIC sometimes duplicates the MAC
address on the ifcfg configuration files.
* Additional admin only API methods are missing (ie. Domain management, router
management).
* Usage parse engine could go OOM in the event it has not been run recently
and there are a large (2 million+ records).
* Problem with domU when both e1000 and e1000e used as a NIC drivers for a
Computing Server.  The installer needs to blacklist one of the drivers.
* vnet failures and xen crashes currently do not generate an alert to the administrator.
* The current limit for domU instances created on a Computing Server is 64 and
the currently limit for domR instances created is 59 on a Routing Server.
* No current way of allowing different subnets for different pods within the
same zone.
* limit the number of usage and event records returned by the API.  A large
enough of the query could cause the Management Server to go oom.

=================================
BUG FIXES :
=================================

* Improved transactions across both database calls and calls across agents.
* Fixed an issue where duplicate IP or LB rules could be sent to the DomR
instance during a DomR restart.
* Removed requirement of the reverse DNS lookup for the Storage Server.
* Massive improvements to the HA process.
* Fixed an issue where the it would take too long for the management server
to detect a TCP disconnect.
* Fixed an issue where the the agent would *think* it has connected to the 
management server but in reality, it is just stuck waiting for a response that
will never come.
* Generic DB lock wait timeout fixes.
* Improvements to the general state management of the servers.
* Fixed issue where where physical servers with the same IP attempts to connect
to the Management Server.  The second server is now prevented from registering.
* Fixed an issue where deleting a user from an account would result in all the
virtual machines to be cleaned up.  This can only happen if the last user for
an account has been deleted.
* Fixed an issue where the source NAT ip address of a DomR instance is being
released back into the public pool even though the DomR instance was not 
successfully destroyed.
* Fixed an issue where a guest virtual machine cannot be destroyed while in HA
state.
* Removed requirement to specify the storage type when installing a new tempate.
* Fixed an issue where the console proxy from different zones are all starting
in the same zone.
* Fixed an issue where the listing of virtual machines would hang if the console
proxy is not even started.
* Massive improvements to our installer scripts.
* Massive improvements to the general stability of the Cloud Stack.
* Fixed an issue where the Hypervisor installer is unable to install onto 
machines with a IPMI card.
* As usual, there are too many bug fixes to list...

********************************************************************************

=================================
WHAT'S NEW :
=================================

* VMOps Server
  - Complete web UI for both administrators and users to manage VMOps Cloud
    Stack.  
  - Allows administrators to manage the creation of service offerings and set
    its pricing along with pricing for network bandwidth, additional public
    ips, and vm templates.
  - Allows administrators to retrieve billing records and user usages.
  - VM Sync - coordinates, manages, and maintains the life cycle of VMOps agents 
    running on attached computing, routing, and storage hosts.
  - VM Template Management - allows administrators to manage and upload hosted 
    vm templates into VMOps Cloud Stack.

* VMOps Multitenant Hypervisor
  - Designed to allow for the complete isolation of CPU, memory, storage, and 
    network resources for each user.  
  • Hypervisor Attached Storage (HAS) – The storage solution that is 
    integrated within the hypervisor and does not rely on centralized SAN or NAS
    to implement storage virtualization.  It provides a high performance and 
    ultra-reliable block storage for virtual machine images
  - Hypervisor Aware Network (HAN) – The network solution for VMOps Cloud Stack 
    that implements the necessary IP address translation and tunneling for the 
    guest OS running inside the virtual machine.  It does not rely on VLAN to 
    implement any network virtualization and isolation.
