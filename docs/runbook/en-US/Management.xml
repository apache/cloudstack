<chapter id="chap-Runbook-Management">
  <title>Installation of the management server</title>
  <para>
    Now it is time to start installing CloudStack's management server
    and some of the related components. 
  </para>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-Management-database">
    <title>Database Installation and Configuration</title>
      <para>
        We'll start out by installing <application>MySQL</application> and configuring 
        some options to ensure CloudStack runs well.
      </para>
      <para>
        To install <application>MySQL</application> run the following command:
        <screen><prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>yum</command> -y install mysql-server</userinput></screen>
      </para>
      <para>With <application>MySQL</application> installed we need to make
      a few configuration changes to <filename>/etc/my.cnf</filename>. 
      Specifically we need to add the following options to the [mysqld] section:
        <screen>
innodb_rollback_on_timeout=1
innodb_lock_wait_timeout=600
max_connections=350
log-bin=mysql-bin
binlog-format = 'ROW' 
        </screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        Now that <application>MySQL</application> is properly configured we can
        start it and configure it to start on boot as follows:
        <screen>
          <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>service</command> mysqld start</userinput>
          <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>chkconfig</command> mysqld on</userinput>
        </screen>
      </para>

  </section>
	
  <section id="sect-Runbook-Management-extraction">
    <title>Extraction</title>
    <para>
	The next step is to extract the contents of the CloudStack tarball 
	(mentioned in <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Overview-prereqs" />) you
	downloaded previously. To extract the contents of this tarball use 
	the following command:
    </para>
    <screen>
      <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>tar</command> -xzvf CloudStack-oss-3.0.2-1-rhel6.2.tar.gz</userinput>
    </screen>
    <para> For the next few sections you'll need to <command>cd</command> into the first level that was just created.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-Management-installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>Now that you are in the directory created by extracting the tarball, it's now time to install. We'll run 
      <filename>./install.sh</filename> and choose option <option>M</option>. This will install the management server
      and necessary dependencies. 
    </para>
    <para>With the application itself installed we can now setup the database, we'll do that with the following command
      and options: 
    </para>
    <screen>
      <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>cloud-setup-databases</command> cloud:<replaceable>password</replaceable>@localhost --deploy-as=root</userinput>
    </screen>
    <para>When this process is finished, you should see a message like "CloudStack has successfully initialized the database."
    </para>
    <para>Now that the database has been created, we can take the final step in setting up the management server by issuing the following command:</para>
    <screen>
      <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>cloud-setup-mangament</command></userinput>
    </screen>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-Management-templatesetup">
    <title>System Template Setup</title>
    <para>CloudStack uses a number of system VMs to provide functionality for 
      accessing the console of virtual machines, providing various networking 
      services, and managing various aspects of storage. This step will 
      acquire those system images ready for deployment when we bootstrap
      your cloud.
    </para>
    <para> 
      The place we are going to download these images to is the secondary 
      storage share that we setup earlier, so we'll need to mount that share
      with the <command>mount</command> command run on the management server:
    </para>
    <screen>
      <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>mount</command> -t nfs <replaceable>172.16.10.</replaceable>2/secondary /mnt/secondary</userinput>
    </screen>
    <para>
      Now we need to download the system VM template and deploy that to the
      share we just mounted. The management server includes a script to properly
      manipulate the system VMs images. 
    </para>
    <screen>
      <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>/usr/lib64/cloud/agent/scripts/storage/secondary/cloud-install-sys-tmplt</command> -m  /mnt/secondary -u http://download.cloud.com/templates/acton/acton-systemvm-02062012.qcow2.bz2 -h kvm -F</userinput>
    </screen>
    <para>
      That concludes our setup of the management server. We still need to 
      configure CloudStack, but we will do that after we get our hypervisor
      set up. 
    </para>
