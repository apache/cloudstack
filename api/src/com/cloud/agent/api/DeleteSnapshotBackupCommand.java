     * backupUUID = parent(childUUID)
     * It gets another VHD 
     * previousBackupVHD = parent(backupUUID)
     * 
     * And
     * 1) it coalesces backupUuid into its parent.
     * 2) It deletes the VHD file corresponding to backupUuid
     * 3) It sets the parent VHD of childUUID to that of previousBackupUuid
     * 
     * It takes care of the cases when
     * 1) childUUID is null. - Step 3 is not done.
     * 2) previousBackupUUID is null 
     *       - Merge childUUID into its parent backupUUID
     *       - Set the UUID of the resultant VHD to childUUID
     *       - Essentially we are deleting the oldest VHD file and setting the current oldest VHD to childUUID
