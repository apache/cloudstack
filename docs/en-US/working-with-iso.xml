	<title>Working with ISOs</title>
	<para>&PRODUCT; supports ISOs and their attachment to guest VMs. An ISO is a read-only file that has an ISO/CD-ROM style file system. Users can upload their own ISOs and mount them on their guest VMs.</para>
	<para>ISOs are uploaded based on a URL. HTTP is the supported protocol. Once the ISO is available via HTTP specify an upload URL such as http://my.web.server/filename.iso.</para>
	<para>ISOs may be public or private, like templates.ISOs are not hypervisor-specific.  That is, a guest on vSphere can mount the exact same image that a guest on KVM can mount.</para>
	<para>ISO images may be stored in the system and made available with a privacy level similar to templates. ISO images are classified as either bootable or not bootable. A bootable ISO image is one that contains an OS image. &PRODUCT; allows a user to boot a guest VM off of an ISO image. Users can also attach ISO images to guest VMs. For example, this enables installing PV drivers into Windows.  ISO images are not hypervisor-specific.</para>
