  <title>Advanced Zone Guest IP Addresses</title>
  <para>When advanced networking is used, the administrator can create additional networks for use
    by the guests. These networks can span the zone and be available to all accounts, or they can be
    scoped to a single account, in which case only the named account may create guests that attach
    to these networks. The networks are defined by a VLAN ID, IP range, and gateway. The
    administrator may provision thousands of these networks if desired. Additionally, the
    administrator can reserve a part of the IP address space for non-&PRODUCT; VMs and
    servers.</para>
