To build a systemvm, see ../../../tools/appliance which uses veewee to wrap these scripts inside a debian VM and
export images in various formats.

That build copies in the files that are in the subdirectories, here. Most importantly it installs
config/etc/init.d/cloud-early-config which will mount the systemvm.iso image and invoke
config/opt/cloud/bin/patchsystemvm.sh on the contained cloud-scripts.tar file.

systemvm.iso itself is built using maven; ../../pom.xml first constructs a systemvm.zip and then invokes mkisofs to
turn that into .iso file. The cloudstack management server modifies this .iso file at runtime to inject vital
custom settings into the systemvm before booting it.
