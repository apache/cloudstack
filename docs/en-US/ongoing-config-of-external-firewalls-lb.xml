  <title>Ongoing Configuration of External Firewalls and Load Balancers</title>
  <para>Additional user actions (e.g. setting a port forward) will cause further programming of the
    firewall and load balancer. A user may request additional public IP addresses and forward
    traffic received at these IPs to specific VMs. This is accomplished by enabling static NAT for a
    public IP address, assigning the IP to a VM, and specifying a set of protocols and port ranges
    to open. When a static NAT rule is created, &PRODUCT; programs the zone's external firewall with
    the following objects:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A static NAT rule that maps the public IP address to the private IP address of a
        VM.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>A security policy that allows traffic within the set of protocols and port ranges that
        are specified.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>A firewall filter counter that measures the number of bytes of incoming traffic to the
        public IP.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>The number of incoming and outgoing bytes through source NAT, static NAT, and load balancing
    rules is measured and saved on each external element. This data is collected on a regular basis
    and stored in the &PRODUCT; database.</para>
