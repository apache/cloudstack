  <title>Management Server Load Balancing</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; can use a load balancer to provide a virtual IP for multiple Management
    Servers. The administrator is responsible for creating the load balancer rules for the
    Management Servers. The application requires persistence or stickiness across multiple sessions.
    The following chart lists the ports that should be load balanced and whether or not persistence
    is required.</para>
  <para>Even if persistence is not required, enabling it is permitted.</para>

  <para>In addition to above settings, the administrator is responsible for setting the 'host' global
    config value from the management server IP to load balancer virtual IP address.
    If the 'host' value is not set to the VIP for Port 8250 and one of your management servers crashes,
    the UI is still available but the system VMs will not be able to contact the management server.
