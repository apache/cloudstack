  <title>Events</title>
  <para>An event is essentially a significant or meaningful change in the state of both virtual and
    physical resources associated with a cloud environment. Events are used by monitoring systems,
    usage and billing systems, or any other event-driven workflow systems to discern a pattern and
    make the right business decision. In &PRODUCT; an event could be a state change of virtual or
    physical resources, an action performed by an user (action events), or policy based events
    (alerts).</para>
