Changes to VNCviewer

3.3.3 R3

Fixed KillScreenSaver to only kill windows of the appropriate class.

3.3.3 R2

The -register option now the full quoted program pathname, rather than relying on AppPaths.

Change most ORL references to AT&T and updated copyright.
Some changes in code which only really affect CE build.

  particularly on slow links.

Display defaults to 0 if not specified.
Added -register argument to associate .vnc files with vncviewer.

it appeared after -fullscreen mode had been specified on command 
line.

Many thanks to Randy Brown <rgb@inven.com> for providing the basis of this.

Added -fullscreen option to start in full-screen mode. Based on 
 Daniel J. Rodriksson's <djr@dit.upm.es> suggestions and patches.
Clipboard transfers can now be disabled from options box or using
 -disableclipboard option.

3.3.2 R9

Code restructuring to share more with CE version

Substantial source code restructuring.

3.3.1 R7

Fixed bug in MRU list where an entry could occur more than once.

The MRU list now defaults to the latest server and displays the entries in 
reverse chronological order.

Added logging facilities and -console option to aid debugging.

Shortened the bell beep for those without sound cards.

AltGr works better on Win95 - now raises all the modifiers when it can't
 detect which ones are needed.

An rfbConnFailed error now produces a WarningException instead of an 
ErrorException, so the message is correctly reported.

Fixed a rare bug which caused vncviewer to continue running in the background
under certain circumstances when all windows were closed and the user then 
closed the 'new connection' dialog.

3.3.1 R5

Fixed scrolling bug which would sometimes stop you scrolling to the last pixel 
in X & Y directions.

Fixed clipboard bug which sometimes caused PC-PC sessions to close immediately.

Alt keys now generate XK_Alt rather than XK_Meta.

Number of MRU entries increased to 8.

for assistance with the international keyboard mapping stuff.
