    <title>Submitting Feedback and Getting Help</title>
    <para>The Apache CloudStack project has mailing lists for users and developers. These are the
      official channels of communication for the project and are the best way to get answers about
      using and contributing to CloudStack. It's a good idea to subscribe to the cloudstack-users
      mailing list if you've deployed or are deploying CloudStack into production, and even for test
      deployments.</para>
    <para>The CloudStack developer's mailing list (cloudstack-dev) is for discussions about
      CloudStack development, and is the best list for discussing possible bugs in CloudStack.
      Anyone contributing to CloudStack should be on this mailing list.</para>
    <para>You can also report bugs in CloudStack using the <ulink
        url="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa">Apache Defect Tracking
        System</ulink>.</para>
    <para>To posts to the lists, you'll need to be subscribed. See the <ulink
        url="http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/mailing-lists.html">CloudStack Web site</ulink>
      for instructions.</para>

      <title>Upgrade from 3.0.2 to 4.0.0-incubating</title>
      <para>Perform the following to upgrade from version 3.0.2 to version 4.0.0-incubating. Note
        that some of the steps here are only required if you're using a specific hypervisor. The
        steps that are hypervisor-specific are called out with a note.</para>

          <para>Ensure that you query your IP address usage records and process them or make a
            backup. During the upgrade you will lose the old IP address usage records.</para>
          <para>Starting in 3.0.2, the usage record format for IP addresses is the same as the rest
            of the usage types. Instead of a single record with the assignment and release dates,
            separate records are generated per aggregation period with start and end dates. After
            upgrading, any existing IP address usage records in the old format will no longer be
            available.</para>

      <para>Apache CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating includes the following new features:</para>
      <section id="inter-vlan-routing">
        <title>Inter-VLAN Routing</title>
        <para>Inter-VLAN Routing is the capability to route network traffic between VLANs. This
          feature enables you to set up Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) that can hold multi-tier
          applications. These tiers are deployed on different VLANs that can communicate with each
          other. You can provision VLANs to the tiers your create, and VMs can be deployed on
          different tiers, such as Web, Application, or Database. The VLANs are connected to a
          virtual router, which facilitates communication between the VMs. In effect, you can
          segment VMs by means of VLANs into different networks that can host multi-tier
          applications. Such segmentation by means of VLANs logically separate application VMs for
          higher security and lower broadcasts, while remaining physically connected to the same
          device.</para>
        <para>This feature is supported on XenServer and VMware hypervisors.</para>

      <section id="site-to-site-vpn">
        <title>Site-to-Site VPN</title>
        <para>A Site-to-Site VPN connection helps you establish a secure connection from an
          enterprise datacenter to the cloud infrastructure. This allows users to access the guest
          VMs by establishing a VPN connection to the virtual router of the account from a device in
          the datacenter of the enterprise. Having this facility eliminates the need to establish
          VPN connections to individual VMs.</para>

      <section id="local-storage-support">
        <title>Local Storage Support for Data Volumes</title>
        <para>You can now create data volumes on local storage. The data volume is placed on the
          same XenServer host as the VM instance that is attached to the data volume. These local
          data volumes can be attached to virtual machines, detached, re-attached, and deleted just
          as with the other types of data volume. In earlier releases of CloudStack, only the root
          disk could be placed in local storage.</para>
        <para>Local storage is ideal for scenarios where persistence of data volumes and HA is not
          required. Some of the benefits include reduced disk I/O latency and cost reduction from
          using inexpensive local disks.</para>
        <para>In order for local volumes to be used, the feature must be enabled for the
          zone.</para>
        <para>You can create a data disk offering for local storage. When a user creates a new VM,
          they can select this disk offering in order to cause the data disk volume to be placed in
          local storage.</para>
        <para>You can not migrate a VM that has a volume in local storage to a different host, nor
          migrate the volume itself away to a different host. If you want to put a host into
          maintenance mode, you must first stop any VMs with local data volumes on that host.</para>
        <para>Local storage support for volumes is available for XenServer, KVM, and VMware
          hypervisors.</para>

      <section id="tags">
        <title>Tags</title>
        <para>A tag is a key-value pair that stores metadata about a resource in the cloud. Tags are
          useful for categorizing resources. For example, you can tag a user VM with a value that
          indicates the user's city of residence. In this case, the key would be "city" and the
          value might be "Toronto" or "Tokyo." You can then request CloudStack to find all resources
          that have a given tag; for example, VMs for users in a given city.</para>
        <para>You can tag a user virtual machine, volume, snapshot, guest network, template, ISO,
          firewall rule, port forwarding rule, public IP address, security group, load balancer
          rule, project, VPC, network ACL, or static route. You can not tag a remote access
          VPN.</para>
        <para>You can work with tags through the UI or through the new API commands createTags,
          deleteTags, and listTags. You can define multiple tags for each resource. There is no
          limit on the number of tags you can define. Each tag can be up to 255 characters long.
          Users can define tags on the resources they own, and administrators can define tags on any
          resources in the cloud.</para>
        <para>A new optional input parameter, "tags," has been added to many of the list* API
          commands. The following example shows how to use this new parameter to find all the
          volumes having tag region=canada OR tag city=Toronto:</para>
        <programlisting>command=listVolumes
&amp;listAll=true

        <para>With the addition of Secure Console feature, users can now securely access the VM
          consoles on the XenServer hypervisor. You can either SSH or use the View Console option in
          the Management Server to securely connect to the VMs on the XenServer host. The Management
          Server uses the xapi API to stream the VM consoles. However, there is no change in the way

          system and attach it to a VM. Root administrators, domain administrators, and end users
          can all upload existing volumes to VMs. The upload is performed by using HTTP. The

        <title>Support for Amazon Web Services API</title>
        <para>This release supports Amazon Web Services APIs, including Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
          API. Fidelity with the EC2 API and the installation experience for this functionality are
          both enhanced. In prior releases, users were required to install a separate component
          called CloudBridge, in addition to installing the Management Server. For new installations
          of CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating, this software is installed automatically along with
          CloudStack and runs in a more closely integrated fashion. The feature is disabled by
          default, but can be easily enabled by setting the appropriate global configuration
          parameter and performing a few setup steps.</para>

        <title>The Nicira NVP Plugin</title>
        <para>The Nicira NVP plug-in allows CloudStack to use the Nicira solution for virtualized
          network as a provider for CloudStack networks and services. In CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating
          this plug-in supports the Connectivity service. This service is responsible for creating
          Layer 2 networks supporting the networks created by guests. When a tenant creates a new
          network, instead of a traditional VLAN, a logical network will be created by sending the
          appropriate calls to the Nicira NVP Controller. The plug-in has been tested with Nicira
          NVP versions 2.1.0, 2.2.0 and 2.2.1.</para>

        <title>Support for CAStor Cluster</title>
        <para>CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating supports using a CAStor cluster as the back-end storage
          system for a CloudStack S3 front-end. The CAStor back-end storage for CloudStack extends
          the existing storage classes and allows the storage configuration attribute to point to a
          CAStor cluster. This feature makes use of the CloudStack server's local disk to spool
          files before writing them to CAStor when handling the PUT operations. However, a file must
          be successfully written into the CAStor cluster prior to the return of a success code to
          the S3 client to ensure that the transaction outcome is correctly reported.</para>
        <para>The S3 multipart file upload is not supported in this release. You are prompted with
          proper error message if a multipart upload is attempted.</para>

        <title>Clustered Logical Volume Manager Support for KVM</title>
        <para>This release adds Clustered Logical Volume Manager (CLVM) storage support for KVM
          hosts. With this support, you can use CLVM as primary storage.</para>
        <para>The CLVM support for KVM allows root and data disks (primary storage) to reside on
          Linux logical volumes. The administrators are required to configure CLVM on the KVM hosts
          independent of CloudStack. When the volume groups are available, an administrator can
          simply add primary storage of type CLVM, providing the volume group name. Then CloudStack
          creates and manages logical volumes as needed.</para>
        <para>CLVM also supports Snapshots. CloudStack creates an LVM snapshot, copy the applicable
          logical volume to the secondary storage in the qcow2 format, and then delete the LVM
          snapshot. </para>

          4.0.0-incubating. This can be done by adding a RBD pool as primary storage. Before using
          RBD, ensure that Qemu is compiled with RBD enabled, and the libvirt version is at least
          0.10 with RBD enabled on the KVM host </para>
