Select this option if you want to use two virtual routers in the network for uninterrupted connection: one operating as the master virtual router and the other as the backup. The master virtual router receives requests from and sends responses to the user’s VM. The backup virtual router is activated only when the master is down. After the failover, the backup becomes the master virtual router. &PRODUCT; deploys the routers on different hosts to ensure reliability if one host is down.</para></listitem>
