  <para>XenServer uses a clustered LVM system to store VM images on iSCSI and Fiber Channel volumes
    and does not support over-provisioning in the hypervisor. The storage server itself, however,
    can support thin-provisioning. As a result the &PRODUCT; can still support storage
    over-provisioning by running on thin-provisioned storage volumes.</para>
  <para>KVM supports "Shared Mountpoint" storage. A shared mountpoint is a file system path local to
    each server in a given cluster. The path must be the same across all Hosts in the cluster, for
    example /mnt/primary1. This shared mountpoint is assumed to be a clustered filesystem such as
    OCFS2. In this case the &PRODUCT; does not attempt to mount or unmount the storage as is done
    with NFS. The &PRODUCT; requires that the administrator insure that the storage is
    available</para>
  <!--    <para>Oracle VM supports both iSCSI and NFS storage. When iSCSI is used with OVM, the &PRODUCT; administrator is responsible for setting up iSCSI on the host, including re-mounting the storage after the host recovers from a failure such as a network outage. With other hypervisors, &PRODUCT; takes care of mounting the iSCSI target on the host whenever it discovers a connection with an iSCSI server and unmounting the target when it discovers the connection is down.</para> -->
  <para>With NFS storage, &PRODUCT; manages the overprovisioning. In this case the global
    configuration parameter storage.overprovisioning.factor controls the degree of overprovisioning.
    This is independent of hypervisor type.</para>
  <para>Local storage is an option for primary storage for vSphere, XenServer, and KVM. When the
    local disk option is enabled, a local disk storage pool is automatically created on each host.
    To use local storage for the System Virtual Machines (such as the Virtual Router), set
    system.vm.use.local.storage to true in global configuration.</para>
  <para>&PRODUCT; supports multiple primary storage pools in a Cluster. For example, you could
    provision 2 NFS servers in primary storage. Or you could provision 1 iSCSI LUN initially and
    then add a second iSCSI LUN when the first approaches capacity.</para>
