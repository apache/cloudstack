<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Annual License SOFTWARE.
    Your initial Maintenance shall begin on the date the Licenses are delivered to
    you by email. Maintenance shall continue for a one (1) year term subject to
    your purchase of annual renewals (the "Maintenance Term"). During the
    initial or a renewal Maintenance Term, CITRIX will provide SUPPORT and Updates.
    For the purposes of this AGREEMENT, an "Update" shall mean a
    generally available release of the same SOFTWARE which Citrix makes available
    from time to time. Updates shall be considered SOFTWARE under the terms of this
    AGREEMENT, except they are not covered by the Limited Warranty applicable to
    SOFTWARE, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Maintenance may be
    purchased for the SOFTWARE until it is no longer offered in accordance with the
    CITRIX PRODUCT Support Lifecycle Policy posted at <span style="color:#0200FE">www.citrix.com.
    </span>You acknowledge that CITRIX may develop and market new or different
    computer programs or editions of the SOFTWARE that use portions of the SOFTWARE
    and that perform all or part of the functions performed by the SOFTWARE.
    Nothing contained in this AGREEMENT shall give you any rights with respect to
    such new or different computer programs or editions. You also acknowledge that
    CITRIX is not obligated under this AGREEMENT to make any Updates available to
    the public. Any deliveries of Updates shall be electronic. SUPPORT includes
    unlimited Incidents, unlimited named contacts and 24x7x365 worldwide coverage.
    You may also purchase technical relationship management coverage and consulting
    services as part of SUPPORT. The offering you purchase determines your
    entitlement. An "Incident" is defined as a single SUPPORT issue and
    reasonable effort(s) needed to resolve it. An Incident may require multiple
    telephone calls and offline research to achieve final resolution. The Incident
    severity will determine the response levels for the SOFTWARE. Unused
    entitlements expire at the end of each annual term. SUPPORT may be purchased
    for the SOFTWARE until it is no longer offered in accordance with the CITRIX
    PRODUCT Support Lifecycle Policy posted at <span style="color:#0200FE">www.citrix.com.
    </span>SUPPORT will be provided remotely from CITRIX to your locations. Where
    on-site visits are mutually agreed, you will be billed for reasonable travel
    and living expenses in accordance with your travel policy. CITRIX’ performance
    is predicated upon the following responsibilities being fulfilled by you: (i)
    you will designate a Customer Support Manager ("CSM") who will be the
    primary administrative contact; (ii) you agree to perform reasonable problem
    determination activities and to perform reasonable problem resolution
    activities as suggested by CITRIX; (iii) you are responsible for implementing
    procedures necessary to safeguard the integrity and security of SOFTWARE and
    data from unauthorized access and for reconstructing any lost or altered files
    resulting from catastrophic failures; (iv) you are responsible for procuring,
    installing, and maintaining all equipment, telephone lines, communications
    interfaces, and other hardware at your site and providing CITRIX with access to
    your facilities as required to operate the SOFTWARE and permitting CITRIX to
    perform the service called for by this AGREEMENT; and (v) you are required to
    implement all currently available and applicable hotfixes, hotfix rollup packs,
    and service packs or their equivalent to the SOFTWARE in a timely manner.
    CITRIX is not required to provide any SUPPORT relating to problems arising out
    of: (i) your or any third party’s alterations or additions to the SOFTWARE,
    operating system or environment that adversely affects the SOFTWARE (ii) Citrix
    provided alterations or additions to the SOFTWARE that do not address Errors or
    Defects; (ii) any functionality not defined in the PRODUCT documentation
    published by CITRIX and included with the PRODUCT; (iii) use of the SOFTWARE on
    a processor and peripherals other than the processor and peripherals defined in
    the documentation; (iv) SOFTWARE that has reached End-of-Life; and (v) any
    consulting deliverables from any party. An "Error" is defined as a
    failure in the SOFTWARE to materially conform to the functionality defined in
    the documentation. A "Defect" is defined as a failure in the SOFTWARE
    to conform to the specifications in the documentation. In situations where
    CITRIX cannot provide a satisfactory resolution to your critical problem
    through normal SUPPORT methods, CITRIX may engage its product development team
    to create a private fix. Private fixes are designed to address your specific
    situation and may not be distributed by you outside your organization without
    written consent from CITRIX. CITRIX retains all right, title, and interest in
    and to all private fixes. Any hotfixes or private fixes are not SOFTWARE under
    the terms of this AGREEMENT and they are not covered by the Limited Warranty or
    Infringement Indemnification applicable to SOFTWARE, to the extent permitted by
    applicable law. With respect to consulting services, all intellectual property
    rights in all reports, preexisting works and derivative works of such
    preexisting works, as well as installation scripts and other deliverables and
    developments made, conceived, created, discovered, invented, or reduced to
    practice in the performance of the assessment are and shall remain the sole and
    absolute property of CITRIX, subject to a worldwide, nonexclusive License to
    you for internal use.</span></p>

    RIGHTS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBLIGATIONS. You may not transfer, rent, timeshare,
    grant rights in or lease the SOFTWARE except to the extent such foregoing
    restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. If you purchased
    Licenses for the SOFTWARE to replace other CITRIX Licenses for other CITRIX

    engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works based on, or copy the
    SOFTWARE except as specifically licensed herein or to the extent such foregoing
    restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. You may not remove any

    by applicable law, you agree to allow CITRIX to audit your compliance with the
    terms of this AGREEMENT upon prior written notice during normal business hours.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, this AGREEMENT shall not prevent or restrict you
    from exercising additional or different rights to any free, open source code,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">You hereby agree, that
    to the extent that any applicable mandatory laws (such as, for example,
    national laws implementing EC Directive 91/250 on the Legal Protection of
    Computer Programs) give you the right to perform any of the aforementioned
    activities without the consent of CITRIX to gain certain information about the

    INDEMNIFICATION. CITRIX shall indemnify and defend, or at its option, settle
    any claim, suit, or proceeding brought against you based on an allegation that
    the SOFTWARE (excluding Open Source Software) infringes upon any patent or
    copyright of any third party ("Infringement Claim"), provided you
    promptly notify CITRIX in writing of your notification or discovery of an
    Infringement Claim such that CITRIX is not prejudiced by any delay in such
    notification. For purposes of this Section 4, "Open Source Software"
    means software distributed by Citrix under an open source licensing model
    (e.g., the GNU General Public License, BSD or a license similar to those
    approved by the Open Source Initiative). CITRIX will have sole control over the
    defense or settlement of any Infringement Claim and you will provide reasonable
    assistance in the defense of the same. Following notice of an Infringement
    Claim, or if CITRIX believes such a claim is likely, CITRIX may at its sole
    expense and option: (i) procure for you the right to continue to use the
    alleged infringing SOFTWARE; (ii) replace or modify the SOFTWARE to make it
    non-infringing; or (iii) accept return of the SOFTWARE and provide you with a
    refund as appropriate. CITRIX assumes no liability for any Infringement Claims
    or allegations of infringement based on: (i) your use of any SOFTWARE after notice
    that you should cease use of such SOFTWARE due to an Infringement Claim; (ii)
    any modification of the SOFTWARE by you or at your direction; or (iii) your
    combination of SOFTWARE with non-CITRIX programs, data, hardware, or other
    materials, if such Infringement Claim would have been avoided by the use of the
    SOFTWARE alone. THE FOREGOING STATES YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
    INFRINGEMENT CLAIM. </span></p>
