        <title>Asynchronous Commands</title>
    <para>Asynchronous commands were introduced in &PRODUCT; 2.x. Commands are designated as asynchronous when they can potentially take a long period of time to complete such as creating a snapshot or disk volume.  They differ from synchronous commands by the following:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>They are identified in the API Reference by an (A).</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>They will immediately return a job ID to refer to the job that will be responsible in processing the command.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>If executed as a "create" resource command, it will return the resource ID as well as the job ID.</para>
                <para>You can periodically check the status of the job by making a simple API call to the command, queryAsyncJobResult and passing in the job ID.</para>
            </listitem>
