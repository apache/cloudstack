/**
 *   - Designs a virtual network depending on the network offering.
 *   - Implements the virtual network when a virtual machine requires the network to be started.
 *
 * There can be multiple NetworkGurus in a CloudStack system.  Each NetworkGuru
 * resources when VMs are gone.
 *
 * A Network goes through the following life cycles through the NetworkGuru.
 *   - When a guest network is created, NetworkGuru is asked to "design" the network.
 *     This means the NetworkGuru checks the parameters such as cidr, gateway,
 *     vlan, etc and returns a network that can work with those parameters.
 *     Note that at this point the network is only a virtual network.  It has
 *     not been substantiated with resources, such as vlan, to make the network
 *     functional in the physical environment.  At this stage, the network is in
 *     Allocated state.
 *
 *   - When the first virtual machine is about to be started and requires network
 *     services, the guest network needs to have resources to make it usable
 *     within the physical environment.  At this time, the NetworkGuru is
 *     called with the implement() method to acquire those resources.
 *
 *   - For every virtual machine starting in the network, the NetworkGuru is
 *     asked via the reserve() method to make sure everything the virtual
 *     machine needs to be functional in the network is reserved.
 *
 *   - For every virtual machine being stopped in the network, the NetworkGuru
 *     is informed via the release() method to make sure resources occupied
 *     by the virtual machine is released.
 *
 *   - If all virtual machines within the network have been stopped, the guest
 *     network is garbage collected.  When a guest network is garbage collected
 *     the NetworkGuru is informed via the shutdown() method to release any
 *     resources it allocated to that network.
 *
 *   - When a guest network is being deleted, the NetworkGuru is informed via
 *     the trash() method.
