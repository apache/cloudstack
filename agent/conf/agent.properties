# Sample configuration file for CloudStack agent

# The GUID to identify the agent with, this is mandatory!
# Generate with "uuidgen"
guid=

#resource= the java class, which agent load to execute
resource=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.LibvirtComputingResource

#workers= number of threads running in agent
workers=5

#host= The IP address of management server
host=localhost

#port = The port management server listening on, default is 8250
port=8250

#cluster= The cluster which the agent belongs to
cluster=default

#pod= The pod which the agent belongs to
pod=default

#zone= The zone which the agent belongs to
zone=default

#public.network.device= the public nic device
# if this is commented, it is autodetected on service startup
# public.network.device=cloudbr0

#private.network.device= the private nic device
# if this is commented, it is autodetected on service startup
# private.network.device=cloudbr1

#guest.network.device= the guest nic device
# if this is commented, the private nic device will be used

# local storage path, by default, it's /var/lib/libvirt/images/
#local.storage.path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/

# The UUID for the local storage pool, this is mandatory!
# Generate with "uuidgen"
local.storage.uuid=

# Location for KVM scripts
domr.scripts.dir=scripts/network/domr/kvm

# the timeout for time-consuming operations, such as create/copy snapshot
#cmds.timeout=7200

# set the vm migrate speed, by default, it will try to guess the speed of the guest network
# In MegaBytes per second
#vm.migrate.speed=0

# set the type of bridge used on the hypervisor, this defines what commands the resource 
# will use to setup networking. Currently supported NATIVE, OPENVSWITCH
#network.bridge.type=native

# set the driver used to plug and unplug nics from the bridges
# a sensible default will be selected based on the network.bridge.type but can
# be overridden here.
# native = com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.BridgeVifDriver
# openvswitch = com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.OvsVifDriver
#libvirt.vif.driver=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.BridgeVifDriver

# set the hypervisor type, values are: kvm, lxc
# hypervisor.type=kvm

# set the hypervisor URI. Usually there is no need for changing this
# For KVM: qemu:///system
# For LXC: lxc:///
# hypervisor.uri=qemu:///system

# settings to enable direct networking in libvirt, should not be used
# on hosts that run system vms, values for mode are: private, bridge, vepa
# libvirt.vif.driver=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.DirectVifDriver
# network.direct.source.mode=private
# network.direct.device=eth0

# setting to enable the cpu model to kvm guest globally.
# three option:custom,host-model and host-passthrough.
# custom - user custom the CPU model which specified by guest.cpu.model.
# host-model - identify the named CPU model which most closely matches the host,
# and then request additional CPU flags to complete the match. This should give
# close to maximum functionality/performance, which maintaining good
# reliability/compatibility if the guest is migrated to another host with slightly different host CPUs.
# host-passthrough - tell KVM to passthrough the host CPU with no modifications.
# The difference to host-model, instead of just matching feature flags,
# every last detail of the host CPU is matched. This gives absolutely best performance,
# and can be important to some apps which check low level CPU details,
# but it comes at a cost wrt migration. The guest can only be migrated to
# an exactly matching host CPU.
#
# guest.cpu.mode=custom|host-model|host-passthrough
# This param is only valid if guest.cpu.mode=custom,
# for examples:"Conroe" "Penryn", "Nehalem", "Westmere", "pentiumpro" and so
# on,run virsh capabilities for more details.
# guest.cpu.model=
