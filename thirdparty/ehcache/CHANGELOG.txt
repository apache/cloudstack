ehcache-1.5.0
=============

<release version="1.5.0" date="2008-07-12" desc="1.5.0 Maintenance release">
    <!--Bug Fixes-->
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1977481">
        Fix loading of net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheProvider from multiple class loaders. The insistence
        that a leading slash be at the front of the "net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName" property has been removed.
        If this fix causes anyone an issue, add the "/" to the front of your path.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1990091">
        Updated the BlockingCache.get() JavaDoc to clarify the contract when a RuntimeException is thrown.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="2002319">
        Added a more meaningful LOG message when a null element is encountered from a replication. The only reason
        that an element can be null is because a SoftRefernence has been reclaimed by the JVM. The log message
        recommends either increasing heap or setting -Xms to be the same as -Xmx as the Sun JDK will reclaim SoftReferences
        in preference to increasing heap.
    </action>
    <!--Changes-->
     <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update">
        The remote debugger has had many improvements. It is now packaged in its own tarball available from the downloads
         page, and also continues to be published as a maven module. It is not in the core tarball so that more focus
         can be given to it.
    </action>

ehcache-1.5.0-beta2
===================

<release version="1.5.0-beta2" date="2008-06-7" desc="Second beta of 1.5.0 Maintenance release">
    <!--Bug Fixes-->
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix">
        Fixes to changes made in 1.5.0-beta1: token replacement in ehcache.xml parsing and Cache.get() not searching
        the DiskStore.

</release>


ehcache-1.5.0-beta1
===================

<release version="1.5.0" date="2008-12-31" desc="Maintenance release">
    <!-- Features and Enhancements -->
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1730405">
        Added JGroups Implementation. Thanks to Pierre Monestie for the patch(es) for this. Though new to the
        core distribution
        JGroups replication has been in production use in a large cluster for the last 10 months.
        Applied through patches 1730405 and 1912931.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1812267">
        CachingFilter changed to use BufferedOutputStream rather than OutputStream. This is a performance
        improvement.
        Thanks to Vitaly Baranovsky for the patch.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1748591">
        Removed setThreadName usage to increase performance.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1795131">
        JCache interface improvement. if we want preload for this cache, and we probably don't know all
        the keys at the system startup time. We may want to have new interface: loadAll()
        This will not be added to ehcache until it gets added to the JCACHE spec.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1795131">
        Clarified JavaDoc and behaviour so that Cache.getQuiet does not update Element statistics but also
        cache statistics.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1909427">
        Enhanced behaviour of diskPersistent so that it will work for MemoryStore only caches. On shutdown
        the memory store will be written to disk and on startup loaded up into memory. But DiskStore itself
        will not be used during cache operation.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1728061">
        The diskStore element in ehcache.xml is now optional. If all caches use only MemoryStores, then
        there is no need to worry about configuring diskStore. This will simplify configurations particularly
        where multiple CacheManagers are being used.

        If one or more caches requires a DiskStore, and none is configured, java.io.tmpdir will be used and
        a warning message will be logged to encourage explicity configuration of the diskStore path.

        Thanks to Robert Watkins for suggesting this one.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1887683">
        By default RMI will assign a random listener port to a new Remote object which prevents its operation
        through firewalls. Added a new property remoteListenerPort to RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory
        to enable it to be specified.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1958670">
        Made ManagementService accessible from IoC containers by providing a constructor.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1898239">
        Added a new system property expansion token "ehcache.disk.store.dir" to DiskStore configuration which
        can be
        used to specify the DiskStore directory on the command line or in an environment variable.

        e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...

        Thanks to Brian Chan and others for suggesting this one.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add" issue="1743082">
        Add the ability to specify system property tokens using ${tokenname} in ehcache.xml which are then
        replaced when the
        configuration is loaded.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1912953">
        Updated the remote debugger with enhanced reporting and better documentation (See Logging page in
        the documentation).

        The new version prints a list of caches with replication configured, prints notifications as they
        happen, and periodically prints the cache name, size and total events received.
    </action>


    <!--Bug Fixes-->
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="812270">
        SimplePageCachingFilter returns same content for GET and HEAD. This one is an edge case that can happen.
        Thanks to Vitaly Baranovsky for the patch.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1890915">
        Change CachingFilter to use setHeader rather than addHeader which was duplicating some headers.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1936731">
        Updated the JavaDoc to clarify the meaning of the constant SHORT_DELAY.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1888993">
        Fixed inefficient shutdown of cache when the cache is not diskPersistent.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1938744">
        Corrected ehcache.xsd so that minOccurs of cache can be 0. This makes ehcache-default.xml legal.
        Thanks to Andreas Sahlbach for reporting this.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1901094">
        Fixed Cache destroy exception where Hibernate and Spring are both shutting down during
        undeploying application.

    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
        Add CacheExtensions. This is a generic facility which holds a reference to a cache and is bound to the cache lifecycle,

        Excessive CPU and (debug) logging when multicast send fails. Added a sleep to reduce the log spam

ehcache-1.3
===========

        Where the Hibernate EhCacheProvider or SingletonEhCacheProvider is being used with a configurationResourceName to
        load an ehcache configuration other than default, when it is not found in the classpath, no warning or other failure
        occurs. Ehcache will instead load itself from defaults.
        Added a warning message to indicate that a configurationResourceName was specified but could not be found.
        This should simplify debugging. Thanks to Robert Watkins for raising this issue.
    </action>
    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1728780">
        RMIRegistry is now stopped if it was started by ehcache. This fixes a classloader memory leak on redeploy

    <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1732424">

ehcache-1.3-beta3
=================

<action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
    Add the ability to specify the property separator for the properties element in factory configurations.
    This is a new attribute propertySeparator that can be used in ehcache.xml configuration files.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="update">
    Enable the DiskStore to be pluggable in the Store hierarchy. There is no factory configuration as yet for this.
    Thanks to Matt Magoffin for the patch.

<action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" fix="1725911">
    Applied minor patch to Element to allow it to be easily persisted using mechanisms other than Java Serialization.
    Thanks to Matt Magoffin for the patch.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1715492">
    Problems when peer lookup fails when receiving heartbeats because heartbeat receiving is single-threaded. This issue
    affects dirty or misconfigured networks or clusters. It hardens ehcache so that valid peers can still form a cluster
    in the presence of Naming.lookup() problems with one or more peers. Thanks to Daniel Weill and Fredrik Bertilson for
    reporting this and Daniel for supplying a patch. The patch changes the heartbeat receiving implementation to be multi-threaded
    so that one bad peer cannot bring the others down.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1720152">
    Ehcache does asynchronous puts to the DiskStore. In previous version the amount of memory that could be used for spool buffering was
    unlimited. In very high load situations with limited memory this could cause OutOfMemory erros. This version introduces a diskSpoolBufferSizeMB
    configured per cache with a default of 30MB. Set this value to control the maximum amount of memory each cache DiskStore spool can consume.
    The default of 30MB should work well for backward compatibility. If you notice your DiskStore performance is affected negatively,
    increase diskSpoolBufferSizeMB.
</action>
</release>

ehcache-1.3-beta2
=================

<action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix">
    Fix issue reported by Fredrik Bertilsson regarding peers entering and leaving a cluster, where the reentered peer would never get

    Fixed RMICachePeer.getElements so that it does not allow null elements.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1681308">
     DiskStore SpoolThread is too slow under Java 1.6. The Spooling Thread was set to 2, on a scale of 1 to 10
    from lowest to highest priority. Under JDK 1.6, this setting did not allocate enough CPU to enable the
    spool to be cleared in a given situation, whereas under JDK1.5 it did. This seems to be a bug in JDK6.
    The priority is now set to Thread.NORMAL_PRIORITY, which is 5.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="update" issue="1684223">
    Distributed cache - flushing replicationQueue on dispose. We should flush the replication queue rather than
    clear it on dispose.

    Document known issue with Tomcat. The presence of multiple &lt;Host&gt; entries in Tomcat's server.xml prevents
    replication from occuring. Thanks to David Patton for reporting this.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1680964">
    Make clear in the JavaDoc documentation in Cache that RemoteCacheException can be thrown by calls to put,
    remove and removeAll when the cache replication policy is synchronous and a remote peer is unavailable.
    Thanks to Christopher G. Stach II for reporting this issue.
</action>

ehcache-1.3-beta1
=================

<action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
    Added a net.sf.ehcache.jcache package, which is an implementation of JSR107, backed by ehcache.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
    Added a net.sf.ehcache.management package, which contains full JMX instrumentation for ehcache.
</action>

<action dev="Tony Voss" issue="1588796" type="fix">
    Statistics Variables Need to be Longs. Changed internal representation to long in Cache, kept the
    direct getters for backwards compatible and changed the new Statistics class to be long based. Use
    getStatistics() to access the longs with out loss of precision.
    Reapplied. Somehow this got lost from 1.2.4.
</action>
<action dev="Chris Ryan" type="fix">
    Filter was rethrowing IOException as ServletException. The spec is clear that IOException is thrown
    as well. Catching these and rethrowing them as ServletException causes these IllegalStateException
    in Glassfish.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1616492" type="fix">
    JBoss, Spring and some other applications have shutdown hooks. A race condition existed in
    CacheManager#shutdown() such that multiple shutdown hook threads could attempt to shutdown
    the CacheManager at the same time. Added class synchronization to prevent this and also
    added a check for the system property net.sf.ehcache.disableShutdownHook=true which will disable
    addition of the shutdown hook. Reported by various people.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1618798" type="fix">
    Element#equals(Object) causes ClassCastException when the comparison object is not an Element. Fixed.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1636876" type="fix">
    GzipFilter corrupts UTF-8 encoded non-Latin characters. Fixed. Thanks to Matt Raible and Kolodin Kolinko

 <action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1661328" type="fix">
    Fix bug for the combination of Automatic Peer Discovery and synchronous bootstrapping.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="remove">
    Removed the JNDI manual listener and peer provider. This was proving difficult to maintain. Custom
    listeners and providers are pluggable and can be added as an extension to ehcache.
</action>

ehcache-1.2.4
=============

<!-- Feature Changes  -->
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="remove">
    Dropped support for JDK1.3. Resulting changes are proper chained exceptions,
    and no longer requiring commons-collections. This enables some simplifications
    in the code base and eases maintenance.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck/Jody Brownell" type="add">
    Added a maxElementsOnDiskStore attribute to cache. This lets disk stores be
    bounded. LFU eviction is used to decide which element to evict.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck/Jody Brownell" type="add">
    Combined the DiskStore's expiry and spool threads. They were competing for the
    same locks anyway. This reduces the maximum number of threads used from 2 to 1 per
    DiskStore.
</action>
<action dev="Tony Voss" issue="1588976" type="add">
    Enable the timeToLive to be set on the cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory. This enables
    the spread of multicast packets to be controlled from a single host to the Internet.
    The default is 1, which is the same as the Java default so the default behavior will not
    change for existing users.
</action>

<!-- Reported Bug fixes -->
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1574735" type="fix">
    Fix typo in lock timeout log message in BlockingCache. Thanks to Matt Magoffin

</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1579761" type="fix">
    Fix issue where it is not possible to specify a DiskStore path consistently
    on all operating systems. This is a workaround to a JDK bug. Always create
    paths like "java.io.tmpdir/cache". Any trailing characters to java.io.tmpdir
    added for windows and solaris will be removed and placed with a single file
    separator.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1563017" type="fix">
    Fixed NullPointerException on Cache.evictExpiredElements() and added some other NPE
    guards to Cache.

<action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1585015" type="fix">
    Synchronous bootstrap and manual peer discovery combination does not work because
    the first cache to start always fails. This is normal and the CacheManager should

<action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
    Added a new notifyRemoveAll cache event notification as requested by users. Called during Ehcache#removeAll() to
    indicate that the all elements have been removed from the cache in a bulk operation. The usual

    This notification exists because clearing a cache is a special case. It is often
    not practical to serially process notifications where potentially millions of elements
    have been bulk deleted.
</action>
<action dev="Greg Luck" type="add">
    Added a new notifyElementEvicted cache event notification as requested by users.
    Called immediately after an element is evicted from the cache. Evicted in this sense
    means evicted from one store and not moved to another, so that it exists nowhere in the
    local cache. In a sense the Element has been <i>removed</i> from the cache, but it is different,
    thus the separate notification. The usual notifyElementRemoved is not called.

    Asynchronous replication / soft references.
    There is a trade off between OutOfMemory risk and replication correctness.

ehcache-1.2.2
=============

Maintenance release to ehcache-1.2.1

Feature Changes:
 -  Added a ShutdownListener which implements ServletContextListener for shutting
    down all CacheManagers in a web application.

Bug Fixes:
 -  If you put an Element with overridden TTL and TTI values and then replace it
    with an Element with defaults, the new Element lives forever. putQuiet is not
    affected by this bug. Thanks to Pete at Goodtech for finding this one.

 -  Reduce the memory used by flushSpool() in DiskStore.
    See http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2006/07/tuning_memory_u.html for details.

 -  Cache names with slashes cause problems. Tightened the validation code around setting a cache
    name. Now throw IllegalArgumentException if a cache name is null or contains '/'. Thanks to Daniel
    Wiell for repoting this one and suggesting the fix.

 -  Loading an element from the disk store fails in some circumstances due to classloading
    issues. This issue was created by a patch to fix 1324221 back in October 2005. Resolved
    by trying the new way and then, if a ClassNotFoundException is thrown, doing it the old way.
    CachingFilter should not change Thread name. Now sets it back to the original when done.



ehcache-1.2.1
=============

ehcache-1.2.1 is mostly a maintenance release of ehcache.

Change Blocking cache to use a lock striping technique for its Mutexes. This limits the number
of Mutexes to 100, rather than a number equalling the number of keys, while preserving excellent
liveness and safety. Thanks to Olaf Krische for reporting this and Brian Goetz for assisting with
a solution.

Change BlockingCache and SelfPopulatingCache to act as decorators for Ehcache. Remove now redundant
BlockingCacheManager and SelfPopulatingCacheManager. Change signatures of these caches from Serializable
to Object. This change is not backward compatible but no libraries use these, so developers can change
over on their own projects.

Bug fixes:
- Bug 1190614. This was reported by Victor Volle and is a duplicate of 1492900. Fixed.
- Bug 1506399. Changing all classloading to the context classloader is sometimes inconvenient. Fallback to
- ClassLoaderUtil.class.getClassLoader() if Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
  fails. Thanks to Robert Watkins for reporting this one.
- Bug 1508623. Debug messages generate excess String objects. Added logging level guards around about 6 debug log statements.
  Thanks to Derek Hulley for pointing this one out.
- Harden all ehcache threads so that RuntimeExceptions and Errors do not stop them. This change, on its own, has been
  backported to a separate release, ehcache-1.2.0_01.

ehcache-1.2.1RC
===============

This is a release candidate for ehcache-1.2.1. There are a few very minor bug fixes in this release.

The main focus is to resolve upgrade difficulties with client libraries which expect ehcache CacheManagers to be
singletons as they were in ehcache-1.1. In ehcache-1.2 any attempt to have two CacheManagers sharing the same
configuration resulted in a CacheException being thrown. The check was made on diskStorePath. In ehcache-1.2.1RC
multiple CacheManagers sharing the same ehcache.xml configuration is permitted.

To resolve conflicts with DiskStore paths, the second and subsequent CacheManagers create their data files in a
unique subdirectory under the first CacheManager's diskStore path.

The other potential conflict is in CacheManagerPeerListeners. In the default implementation the conflict is with RMI
listener ports. To resolve this conflict the second and subsequent CacheManagers use a free port to listen on.

For both, warning messages are logged encouraging clients to migrate over to their own ehcache.xml.

There are also a number of enhancements/new features.

Details of changes are:

- Added the constructs package which was previously a separate module. The constructs package adds valuable functionality and given that the 1.2 jar size is large, can be added with only a small increase in jar size.	Greg Luck
- Allow zeroconf of RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. A configuration < cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"/ > will now work. The listener port will be automatically assigned a free port. Fixes 1483735.	Greg Luck
- New SingletonEhCacheProvider for use by Hibernate in situations where code has been written which relies on the singleton behaviour of ehcache-1.1 and earlier. Most code bases using Hibernate should not require this.	Greg Luck
- Allow cacheEventListenerFactory elements to be added to defaultCache in ehcache.xml. This allows caches created with CacheManager.a ddCache(String cacheName) to receive events. This can be used for example to set default replication settings in defaultCache.	Greg Luck
- To complement full support foe default cache (above), added support for programmatic addition of caches which include CacheReplicators. Also support for removal of these caches with CacheManager.remove(String cacheName).	Greg Luck
- Andy McNutt's JNDI-based manual RMI replication added. See ehcache.xml example for how to use.	Greg Luck
- Support tomcat 5.5 for the servlet filters. Tomcat integration testing, in addition to the Orion one, is also added to the full JUnit test process. Tomcat relies on Servlet 2.4 dispatcher INCLUDE and FORWARD directives for page fragment caching.	Greg Luck
- Support runtime setting of individual Element time to lives, time to idles and eternal overrides. If an override is set, the Element expiry ignores the Cache default.	Greg Luck
- Add a cache bootstrap mechanism. This is used to populate a cache when it is first initialized. An abstract factory, BootstrapCacheLoaderFactory has been defined along with an interface BootstrapCacheLoader. The initial concrete implementations are for RMI, so that a new cache entering a cluster gets bootstrapped from a randomly chosen peer.	Greg Luck
- Theoretically possible NPE if a MulticastRMICacheManagerPeerProvider is started and then stopped before a multicast socket connecti on can be established. Added guard for NPE. Thanks to Roman Kurmanowytsch for reporting the issue and a fix. Fixes 1480442.	Greg Luck
- Add shutdown hook to RMICacheManagerPeerListener so that, even if CacheManager.shutdown() is not called, processes still exit cleanly. This is a bug rather than a feature request because Cache has a shutdown hook to always cleanly shut down disk store, and ehcache should be consistent in supporting shutdown hooks. Fixes 1485765.	Greg Luck
- In GzipFilter and CachingFilter Gzipping an empty response body creates 20 byte responses. Fixed so that this situation is detected and a zero bytes gzipped body, with a content length also of 0 is returned. Can occur in 204 and 304 responses. Fixes 1486858.	Greg Luck
- Changed localhost lookup to a static in Cache, to avoid a potential bottleneck when creating and destroying large numbers of caches rapidly. Thanks to Derek Hully for the bug report and suggested fix. Fixes 1488853.
- Allow CacheManager instances to use the same ehcache.xml configuration. Automatically resolve conflicts for DiskStore and CacheManagerPeerListener. Log a warning that the conflict existed and what was done to resolve it along with a suggestion to either use ehcache in singleton mode or specify separate ehcache.xml configurations for each CacheManager instance.

ehcache-1.2
===========
ehcache-1.2. ehcache-1.2 represents the addition of many new features while remaining backward compatible with 1.1.

Changing the API to Object from Serializable breaks projects. Leave the existing Serializable API in place and add new constructors and methods for Object. Add getObjectValue and getObjectKey to Element. Fixes 1473833.	Greg Luck
Closing Cache does not remove reference from DiskStore, preventing Garbage Collection of DiskStore and Cache on dispose of a cache. Fixed to set Cache reference to null on dispose. Thanks to Felix Meschberger for the patch. Fixes 1474363.	Greg Luck
Closing Cache does not remove shutdown hook, preventing Garbage Collection of a Cache with a persistent DiskStore on dispose of a cache. Fixed to remove the shutdown thread after dispose. Thanks to Felix Meschberger for the patch. Fixes 1474360.	Greg Luck


ehcache-1.2rc1
==============

ehcache-1.2 release candidate 1. ehcache-1.2 represents the addition of many new features while remaining
         backward compatible with 1.1.

License updated to Apache 2.0.	Greg Luck
Following many requests, ehcache no longer requires that Elements contain Serializable keys and values. Ehcache will gracefully degrade for those operations which require Serialization. In particular the MemoryStore and event listeners can be used with Non Serializable elements. WARNING error messages are logged when an operation cannot be completed because the key or value is not Serializable.	Greg Luck
Feature Request 1458049 Wrap original exceptions during configuration. Added an intial cause Throwable field to CacheException to facilitate easier reporting without breaking pre JDK1.4 compatibility.	Greg Luck
Removed the old Hibernate plugin from the code base. It has been deprecated since the beginning of the 1.2 beta series. The plugin is being actively maintained in the Hibernate project. Any project still using net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.Plugin should change their Hibernate configurations to org.hibernate.cache.EHCacheProvider.	Greg Luck
Feature Request 1081071. Added the ability to specify subdirectories under System Property paths. e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one	Greg Luck
Feature Request 1025706. Added the ability to specify a system property, net.sf.ehcache.disabled=true, to easily disable ehcache. A disabled cache works fully but discards and Elements added to it.	Greg Luck
Add protections to the DiskStore spoolThread against programming errors in Elements that can cause it to die. Secondly, if it does die, disable adding elements to the DiskStore and log an error, so as to gracefully degrade. Fixes 1432458.	Greg Luck
flush() was using up to double the memory used by a MemoryStore during flush() which could cause an OutOfMemory error on shutdown if memory was constrained. flush no longer causes any memory spike. Thanks to Sergey Nekoval for reporting the bug. Fixes 1369073.	Greg Luck




ehcache-1.2 beta5
=================

This changelog covers beta1 to beta5.

ehcache-1.2 represents the addition of many new features while remaining backward compatible with 1.1.

Introduced new caching policies in addition to the standard LRU. FIFO and LFU were added. LRU remains the default unless explicitly set in each cache's configuration. Thanks to Surya Suravarapu for working with me on these. The documentation has a new section on caching policies and when to use what.	Surya Suravarapu
Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener interfaces and default implementations. These can be configured in ehcache.xml or set programmatically. Thanks to steve at jofti dot com for help with the specification for these.	Greg Luck
After requests from Jo Walnes, Paul Hammant and others, I have added normal instance constructers to CacheManager which do not act as singletons. The factory singleton methods remain for backward compatibility. CacheManager can now be constructed with a Configuration object programmatically.	Greg Luck
Since version 1.1, ehcache has had a persistent diskStore, which makes it suitable for storing application state. Added a flush method so that, if the cache is diskPersistent, it can be programmatically flushed, in addition to the automatic flush which happens at shutdown.	Greg Luck
Pluggable Distributed Caching. The default implementation supports cache discovery via multicast or manual configuration. Updates are delivered asynchronously or s ynchronously via custom RMI connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be plugged in by third parties.	Greg Luck
DiskStore is now up to 12 times faster in certain operations and much more scalable.	Greg Luck
Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases, after introduction of finer grained threading. Thanks to Robert Watkins for reporting on the performance limits.	Greg Luck
Clover test coverage raised to 86%.	Greg Luck
Feature Request 431481 Distributed: The ability to notify cache event listeners excluding CacheReplicators	Greg Luck
Feature Request 1431393 Events from remote in distributed cache should be received by any non CacheReplicator listeners	Greg Luck
Patch 1158788. Fix for dependencies list... MemoryStore.java to remove Apache commons-collections for JDK1.4 users	Greg Luck
change default configuration to use context classloader Fixes 1122734.	Greg Luck
Fix for DiskStore to deserialize using Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() Fixes 1324221.	Greg Luck
CacheManager.shutdown now uses a Class rather than an instance lock. Fixes 1261613.	Greg Luck
Configurator gets a file not found when files contain spaces. Fixes 1237017.	Greg Luck
DiskStore degrades under load. Fixes 1332728.	Greg Luck
Change classloader to Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() for ehache.xml. Fixes 1079529.	Greg Luck
DiskStore data file is not deleted when index is corrupt. Fixes 1414674.	Greg Luck
JavaDoc documentation fix for element.getLastAccessTime returns 0 for element just created Fixes 1224325.	Greg Luck
Documentation should advise using the Hibernate supplied plugin rather than the older one in ehcache which is now deprecated. Fixes 1247019.	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. Removed Boolean.parseBoolean and java.util.Queue which were introduced in the JDK1.5 API to preserve backward compatibility. Fixes .	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. Changed ant script to avoid compiling with clover in dists Fixes .	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. Cannot load configuration from jar (or any non-file URL). Fixes 1410374.	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. NPE on RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory when rmiUrls not specified. Now throws a meaningful CacheException. Fixes 1432074.	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. Deadlock on deserialization of a cache entry. Thanks to Felix Meschberger for reporting the bug and uploading a patch. Fixes 1445694.	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. Caches created with Cache.addCache(String) share a RegisteredEventListeners instance. Thanks to Olaf Ontaine for for reporting the bug and showing how it happens. Fixes 1457268.	Greg Luck
Fix bug introduced in 1.2 beta series. RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator mishandling non-copy updates. Thanks to Randy Puro for a patch. Fixes 1451780.	Greg Luck


ehcache-1.1
===========

Feature Changes
---------------
1. Split out the entire constructs package. These are now in a new subproject: ehcache-constructs, which has been released.
   See http://ehcache.sf.net/ehcache-constructs for more details.
2. Consequenty removed the dependency on Doug Lea's concurrency library.
3. Add new documentation on cache configuration and hibernate performance tuning.

Bug Fixes
---------
1. 1063908 Extra check to make sure that we always close persistent disk store's FileInputStream in the rare
   case where the ObjectInputStream is null.


ehcache-1.0
===========

Feature Changes
---------------
1. Added SelfPopulatingCacheManager

2. Added a new diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds configuration option to ehcache.xml, to allow
tuning of the expiry thread per cache.

3. Added a new diskPersistent feature and configuration option. diskPersistent makes disk stores
persistent between CacheManager and JVM restarts. It enables very long held caches to be configured, useful
for very expensive cache entries that are long lives, such as mapping geocodes.


Bug Fixes
---------
1. Expiry Thread now has a default time of 2 minutes, not 25.

2. Expiry Thread now dies immediately on DiskStore disposal.

3. cache.calculateInMemorySize() now returns a non-zero value

4. Bug 1025130 - Null Pointer Exception when no default cache configured. Now we throw a CacheException with a
   meaningful message.

5. Bug 1025128 IBM Websphere alway requires commons-collection.jar, even though it is never used. Updated requirements
to note this.

6. Patch 1030960. JDK1.4 and higher now chain exception thrown from SelfPopulatingCache.

7. 1033061	Fix to Thread naming in SelfPopulatingCache so that the old name is always put back.

8. 1003659	build script unfriendly to IDE: IDE builds should now work.


ehcache-0.9
===========

Feature Changes
---------------
1. ehcache.xml cache definitions can now omit timeToIdle and/or timeToLive, which are now optional attributes.
This will make cache config easier to read for eternal caches.
Either omitting the attributes or setting them to 0 causes them not to be considered when calculating expiry.
Earlier versions of ehcache would have immediately expired all elements if either attribute was set to 0,
so this change should not break any existing code.

2. Added getQuiet and putQuiet methods to Cache. These methods are the same as get and put
   but do not affect statistics.

3. Implemented an Element clone method.

4. Added calculateInMemorySize() method to Cache to measure the approximate size of a cache's
memory footprint.

5. Added a new constructs package. There are blocking, self populating and self populating collections caches.
These are all pull-through caches. They are useful where the cost of creating an entry is high. Details follow:

    BlockingCache - a cache which blocks subsequent threads until the first read thread
    populates a cache entry

    SelfPopulatingCache - a read-through cache. A cache that populates elements as they are requested
    without requiring the caller to know how the entries are populated. It also enables refreshes
    of cache entries without blocking reads on the same entries.

    SelfPopulatingCollectionsCache - a SelfPopulatingCache that adds threading safety where it is known
    in advance that all entries will be collections.

    The package is useful for, inter alia, :

    * Web Page caches
    * Search Engine caches

    See the tests for examples of how to use this package.

    This package requires Doug Lea's concurrency library. A copy is provided in the tools directory
    when you check out the project by cvs. Or, you can get it from http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj/
    Note that if you are not using the constructs package, you do not need the concurrency library.

Bug Fixes
---------
1. JavaDoc fixups

2. Fixed time to idle which was not expiring elements after the idle time had expired. This feature did
not seem to be getting used. It is now useable. Fixed the test which was also broken

3. Fixed bugs with getSize and getKeys, which were not checking for duplicate keys between
the memory and disk stores.

Testing
-------
1. Increased Clover test coverage to above 80%.

2. Added many new tests for idle expiry.

3. Added tests for the new constructs package. These tests demonstrate concurrency performance
differences between blocking cache designs based on notify/notifyAll and Doug Lea's concurrency package.

4. Test new xml format scenarios for eternal, time to idle and time to live

5. Started adding performance tests to ensure there are no regressions over time.

ehcache-0.8
===========
Bug Fixes
---------
1. Fixed a very rare null pointer exception, when retrieving a cache entry.

Testing
-------
1. Investigated a Hibernate SessionFactory bug and clarified it was not a Hibernate bug. Added test.
2. Investigated a cache size possible bug and clarified it is not in EHCache. Added test.
3. Added Clover test coverage reporting. Clover instrumentation is not included in release jars.
4. Updated Hibernate testing to version 2.1.1

Licensing
---------
1. Modified the Apache license at the request of the Apache Cocoon project.

ehcache-0.7
===========
Bug Fixes
---------
1. Cache Configuration
Fixed null pointer exception where the disk store path was not specified when use disk store is set to false
2. JDK1.3 Compatibility
Replaced JDK1.4 Exception constructors with simple message constructors compatible with JDK1.2 and 1.3
3. Problem with Element expiry
Fixed bug where expiry checking on get was calling remove with the element rather than the key.
4. Expire thread should not run if the cache is not active
Changed the expire thread to while(active)
5. Expiry thread unnecessarily being created for eternal caches
Skipped creating the expiry thread if caches are eternal.

ehcache-0.6
===========
Bug Fixes
---------
1. Hibernate Cache Provider.
Fixed bug where incompatible timestamps were generated
2. "Time to Idle" documentation bug.
Fixed documentation bug in ehcache.xml and ehcache-failsafe.xml where "Time to Live" was
incorrectly referred to as "Time to Idle"

Feature Changes
---------------
1. Remove SoftReferences
SoftReferences for cache element values has been replaced with standard references.
The JDK 1.4.2 JVM was found to remove SoftReferences in normal operation, rather than
the expected behaviour of use only to avoid memory exhaustion. Caches will now
behave deterministically. Element values will only be removed when the element is
garbage collected.

ehcache-0.5
===========
Bug Fixes
---------
- Implemented not creating a Disk Store when overflowToDisk="false" is set in ehcache.xml
- toString() methods now report on all fields

Feature Changes
---------------
- Changed from JDK1.4 Logging to Commons Logging. This is to permit JDK1.2 and JDK1.3 to use EHCache.

- Added Apache Commons Collections LRUMap as an alternative backing Map for the MemoryStore. The
java.util.LinkedHashMap has been retained and is used automatically for JDK1.4 and higher.

- Added LICENSE.txt to the jar in the distribution

ehcache-0.4
===========

- Initial version, originally based on a fork from JCS plus donated patches.
