Account creation email for new committers.

Follow the instructions at:
http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter

Email is to be sent to root *after* the CLA is registered.
The PMC needs to monitor iclas.txt to be sure that the CLA
is properly received before sending this email. See above.

Don't forget to add their name/email in the email headers
and add the date/Message-Id of the PMC vote summary.

If the new member is already a committer, then just need
to ask root to add them to the UNIX groups.

IPMC member updates the authorization file to add the new 
committer to both the committer-? section and the podling 
section of the file https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization/asf-authorization

New PMC members need to be acknowledged by the IPMC,
after their account is created.
