  <title>Working with Usage</title>
  <para>The Usage Server is an optional, separately-installed part of &PRODUCT; that provides
    aggregated usage records which you can use to create billing integration for &PRODUCT;. The
    Usage Server works by taking data from the events log and creating summary usage records that
    you can access using the listUsageRecords API call. </para>
  <para>The usage records show the amount of resources, such as VM run time or template storage
    space, consumed by guest instances.</para>
  <para>The Usage Server runs at least once per day. It can be configured to run multiple times per
    day.</para>
