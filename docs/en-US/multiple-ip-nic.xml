  <title>Configuring Multiple IP Addresses on a Single NIC</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides you the ability to associate multiple private IP addresses per guest VM
    NIC. In addition to the primary IP, you can assign additional IPs to the guest VM NIC. This
    feature is supported on all the network configurations&mdash;Basic, Advanced, and VPC. Security
    Groups, Static NAT and Port forwarding services are supported on these additional IPs. </para>
  <para>As always, you can specify an IP from the guest subnet; if not specified, an IP is
    automatically picked up from the guest VM subnet. You can view the IPs associated with for each
    guest VM NICs on the UI. You can apply NAT on these additional guest IPs by using network
    configuration option in the &PRODUCT; UI. You must specify the NIC to which the IP should be
    associated.</para>
  <para>This feature is supported on XenServer, KVM, and VMware hypervisors. Note that Basic zone
    security groups are not supported on VMware.</para>

    <title>Port Forwarding and StaticNAT Services Changes</title>
    <para>Because multiple IPs can be associated per NIC, you are allowed to select a desired IP for
      the Port Forwarding and StaticNAT services. The default is the primary IP. To enable this
      functionality, an extra optional parameter 'vmguestip' is added to the Port forwarding and
      StaticNAT APIs (enableStaticNat, createIpForwardingRule) to indicate on what IP address NAT
      need to be configured. If vmguestip is passed, NAT is configured on the specified private IP
      of the VM. if not passed, NAT is configured on the primary IP of the VM.</para>
