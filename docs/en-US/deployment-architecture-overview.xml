	<title>Deployment Architecture Overview</title>
	<para>
        A &PRODUCT; installation consists of two parts: the Management Server
        and the cloud infrastructure that it manages. When you set up and 
        manage a &PRODUCT; cloud, you provision resources such as hosts,
        storage devices, and IP addresses into the Management Server, and
        the Management Server manages those resources.
	</para>
	<para>
        The minimum production installation consists of one machine running
        the &PRODUCT; Management Server and another machine to act as the
        cloud infrastructure (in this case, a very simple infrastructure
        consisting of one host running hypervisor software). In its smallest 
        deployment, a single machine can act as both the Management Server
        and the hypervisor host (using the KVM hypervisor).

    <para>
       A more full-featured installation consists of a highly-available
       multi-node Management Server installation and up to tens of thousands of
       hosts using any of several advanced networking setups. For 
       information about deployment options, see Choosing a Deployment Architecture.
