    <title>About Pods</title>
    <para>A pod often represents a single rack. Hosts in the same pod are in the same subnet.
        A pod is the second-largest organizational unit within a &PRODUCT; deployment. Pods are contained within zones. Each zone can contain one or more pods.
        A pod consists of one or more clusters of hosts and one or more primary storage servers.
        Pods are not visible to the end user.
