<chapter id="working-with-system-vm">
  <title>Working with System Virtual Machines</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; uses several types of system virtual machines to perform tasks in the cloud. In
    general &PRODUCT; manages these system VMs and creates, starts, and stops them as needed based
    on scale and immediate needs. However, the administrator should be aware of them and their roles
    to assist in debugging issues.</para>
  <note>
    <para>You can configure the system.vm.random.password parameter to create a random system VM
      password to ensure higher security. If you reset the value for system.vm.random.password to
      true and restart the Management Server, a random password is generated and stored encrypted in
      the database. You can view the decrypted password under the system.vm.password global
      parameter on the &PRODUCT; UI or by calling the listConfigurations API.</para>
