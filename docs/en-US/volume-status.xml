    <title>Volume Status</title>
    <para>When a snapshot operation is triggered by means of a recurring snapshot policy, a snapshot is skipped if a volume has remained inactive since its last snapshot was taken. A volume is considered to be inactive if it is either detached or attached to a VM that is not running. CloudPlatform ensures that at least one snapshot is taken since the volume last became inactive.</para>
    <para>When a snapshot is taken manually, a snapshot is always created regardless of whether a volume has been active or not.</para>
