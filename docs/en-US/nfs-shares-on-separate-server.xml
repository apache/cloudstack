	<title>Using a Separate NFS Server</title>
	<para>This section tells how to set up NFS shares for secondary and (optionally) primary storage on an NFS server running on a separate node from the Management Server.</para> 
	<para>The exact commands for the following steps may vary depending on your operating system version.</para>
	<warning><para>(KVM only) Ensure that no volume is already mounted at your NFS mount point.</para></warning>
	<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>On the storage server, create an NFS share for secondary storage and, if you are using NFS for primary storage as well, create a second NFS share. For example:</para>
		<programlisting>
# mkdir -p /export/primary
# mkdir -p /export/secondary
		</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>To configure the new directories as NFS exports, edit /etc/exports. Export the NFS share(s) with rw,async,no_root_squash. For example:</para>
			<programlisting># vi /etc/exports</programlisting>
			<para>Insert the following line.</para>
			<programlisting>/export  *(rw,async,no_root_squash)</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>Export the /export directory.</para>
			<programlisting># exportfs -a</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>On the management server, create a mount point for secondary storage. For example:</para>
			<programlisting># mkdir -p /mnt/secondary</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>Mount the secondary storage on your Management Server. Replace the example NFS server name and NFS share paths below with your own.</para>
			<programlisting># mount -t nfs nfsservername:/nfs/share/secondary /mnt/secondary</programlisting>
		</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
