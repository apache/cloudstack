  <title>Deleting and Archiving Events and Alerts</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides you the ability to delete or archive the existing alerts and events that
    you no longer want to implement. You can regularly delete or archive any alerts or events that
    you cannot, or do not want to resolve from the database.</para>
  <para>You can delete or archive individual alerts or events either directly by using the Quickview
    or by using the Details page. If you want to delete multiple alerts or events at the same time,
    you can use the respective context menu. You can delete alerts or events by category for a time
    period. For example, you can select categories such as <emphasis role="bold"
      >USER.LOGOUT</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">VM.DESTROY</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"
      >VM.AG.UPDATE</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">CONFIGURATION.VALUE.EDI</emphasis>, and so on.
    You can also view the number of events or alerts archived or deleted.</para>
  <para>In order to support the delete or archive alerts, the following global parameters have been
    added:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">alert.purge.delay</emphasis>: The alerts older than specified
        number of days are purged. Set the value to 0 to never purge alerts automatically.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">alert.purge.interval</emphasis>: The interval in seconds to wait
        before running the alert purge thread. The default is 86400 seconds (one day).</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <note>
    <para>Archived alerts or events cannot be viewed in the UI or by using the API. They are
      maintained in the database for auditing or compliance purposes.</para>
