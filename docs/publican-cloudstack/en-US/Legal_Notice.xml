  <para>
    Apache CloudStack is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
  </para>
  <para>
    Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
    indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making 
    process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF 
    projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the 
    completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project 
    has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
