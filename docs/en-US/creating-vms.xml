		<title>Creating VMs</title>
		<para>Virtual machines are usually created from a template. Users can also create blank virtual machines. A blank virtual machine is a virtual machine without an OS template. Users can attach an ISO file and install the OS from the CD/DVD-ROM.</para>
	<note><para>Starting with v3.0.3, you can create a VM without starting it. You can determine whether the VM needs to be started as part of the VM deployment.  A new request parameter, startVM, is introduced in the deployVm API to support this feature.  For more information, see the Developer's Guide</para></note>

		<note><para>(XenServer) Windows VMs running on XenServer require PV drivers, which may be provided in the template or added after the VM is created. The PV drivers are necessary for essential management functions such as mounting additional volumes and ISO images, live migration, and graceful shutdown.</para></note>
