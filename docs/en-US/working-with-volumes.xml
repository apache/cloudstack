  <title>Working With Volumes</title>
  <para>A volume provides storage to a guest VM. The volume can provide for a root disk or an
    additional data disk. &PRODUCT; supports additional volumes for guest VMs. </para>
  <para>Volumes are created for a specific hypervisor type. A volume that has been attached to guest
    using one hypervisor type (e.g, XenServer) may not be attached to a guest that is using another
    hypervisor type, for example:vSphere, KVM. This is because the different hypervisors use different
    disk image formats. </para>
  <para>&PRODUCT; defines a volume as a unit of storage available to a guest VM. Volumes are either
    root disks or data disks. The root disk has "/" in the file system and is usually the boot
    device. Data disks provide for additional storage, for example: "/opt" or "D:". Every guest VM
    has a root disk, and VMs can also optionally have a data disk. End users can mount multiple data
    disks to guest VMs. Users choose data disks from the disk offerings created by administrators.
    The user can create a template from a volume as well; this is the standard procedure for private
    template creation. Volumes are hypervisor-specific: a volume from one hypervisor type may not be
    used on a guest of another hypervisor type. </para>
  <note>
    <para>&PRODUCT; supports attaching up to 13 data disks to a VM on XenServer hypervisor versions
      6.0 and above. For the VMs on other hypervisor types, the data disk limit is 6.</para>
