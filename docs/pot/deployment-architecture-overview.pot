msgid "A &PRODUCT; installation consists of two parts: the Management Server and the cloud infrastructure that it manages. When you set up and manage a &PRODUCT; cloud, you provision resources such as hosts, storage devices, and IP addresses into the Management Server, and the Management Server manages those resources."

msgid "The minimum production installation consists of one machine running the &PRODUCT; Management Server and another machine to act as the cloud infrastructure (in this case, a very simple infrastructure consisting of one host running hypervisor software). In its smallest deployment, a single machine can act as both the Management Server and the hypervisor host (using the KVM hypervisor)."
