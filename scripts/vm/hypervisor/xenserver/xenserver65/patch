# This file specifies the files that need
# to be transferred over to the XenServer.
# The format of this file is as follows:
# [Name of file]=[source path],[file permission],[destination path]
# [destination path] is required.
# If [file permission] is missing, 755 is assumed.
# If [source path] is missing, it looks in the same
# directory as the patch file.
# If [source path] starts with '/', then it is absolute path.
# If [source path] starts with '~', then it is path relative to management server home directory.
# If [source path] does not start with '/' or '~', then it is relative path to the location of the patch file.
