the session ID has been changed (i.e. another user logging into the UI via a different tab), 
or it's the first time the user has come to this page.

For single signon purposes, you should set the following cookies so that the UI does not force a logout.

JSESSIONID : jsessionid generated by the mgmt server
username : username
role : 0 = User, 1 = ROOT Admin, 2 = Domain Admin
domainid: domainid 

All values can be retrieved by making a successful AJAX login call to the mgmt server.

If you cannot set these cookies before redirecting to this mgmt UI.  You can uncomment the code
below and as long as you can retrieve the username, password, and domain in another manner (i.e. through
a querystring), you can execute the login command below.
