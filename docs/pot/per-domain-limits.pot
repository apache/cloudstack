msgid "&PRODUCT; allows the configuration of limits on a domain basis. With a domain limit in place, all users still have their account limits. They are additionally limited, as a group, to not exceed the resource limits set on their domain. Domain limits aggregate the usage of all accounts in the domain as well as all accounts in all subdomains of that domain. Limits set at the root domain level apply to the sum of resource usage by the accounts in all domains and sub-domains below that root domain."
