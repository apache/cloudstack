To debug RDP sessions with Network Monitor or Wireshark, you need to
configure RDP server with custom private key. For Network Monitor
Decrypt Expert, you also will need to downgrade RDP server TLS protocol
to version 1.0.

File dev-rdp-config.bat contains instructions to configure RDP to use custom
key, open firewall, disable NLA, downgrade TLS, and start RDP service.

File rdp.pfx contains custom private key (password: test) for use with
rdp-config.bat and Network Monitor Decrypt Expert. If you will generate
your own key, you will need to alter rpd-file.bat to use it
fingerprints.

File rdp-key.pem contains private key in PEM format for use with
Wireshark.

As alternative, mimikatz can be used to extract RDP private key.
