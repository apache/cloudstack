	<programlisting>http://&lt;management-server-ip-address&gt;:8080/client</programlisting>
    <para>On a fresh Management Server installation, a guided tour splash screen appears. On later visits, you’ll see a login screen where you specify the following to proceed to your Dashboard:</para>
    <formalpara>
        <title>Username</title>
        <para>The user ID of your account. The default username is admin.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
        <title>Domain</title>
        <para>If you are a root user, leave this field blank.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>If you are a user in the sub-domains, enter the full path to the domain, excluding the root domain.</para>
    <para>For example, suppose multiple levels are created under the root domain, such as Comp1/hr. The users in the Comp1 domain should enter Comp1 in the Domain field, whereas the users in the Comp1/sales domain should enter Comp1/sales.</para>
