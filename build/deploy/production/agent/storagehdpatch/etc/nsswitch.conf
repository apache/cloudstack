# /etc/nsswitch.dns:
#
# An example file that could be copied over to /etc/nsswitch.conf; it uses
# DNS for hosts lookups, otherwise it does not use any other naming service.
#
# "hosts:" and "services:" in this file are used only if the
# /etc/netconfig file has a "-" for nametoaddr_libs of "inet" transports.

# DNS service expects that an instance of svc:/network/dns/client be
# enabled and online.
