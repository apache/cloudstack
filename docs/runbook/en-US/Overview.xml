    <para>
	Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds can be a complex thing to build, 
	and by definition they have a plethora of options, which often lead to confusion
	for even experienced admins who are newcomers to building cloud platforms. 
	The goal for this runbook is to provide a straightforward set of instructions 
	to get you up and running with CloudStack with a minimum amount of trouble.

      <title>What exactly are we building?</title>
      <para>
	  This runbook will focus on building a CloudStack cloud using KVM with 
	  CentOS 6.2 with NFS storage utilizing Layer-3 for network isolation 
	  (aka Security Groups).

        KVM, or Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a virtualization technology
        for the Linux kernel. KVM supports native virtualization atop 
        processors with hardware virtualization extensions.
