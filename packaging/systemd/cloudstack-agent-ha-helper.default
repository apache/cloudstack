# The agent-ha-helper.py provides a HTTP server which handles API requests to identify if the host (or a neighbour host) is healthy.
# optional arguments:

# PORT  Sets the port to be used by the agent-ha-helper server  (must contains the flag '-p' for Script to add the value)
# Default is 8443. However, if the "insecure" mode is activated, then it uses 8080 by default.
# PORT="-p 8443"

# If uncommented, it passes flag that allows to deploy the HTTP server without SSL (default port would be 8080 in such case)
# If no mode is provided, agent-ha-helper creates HTTP server with support to SSL via cloud.crt and cloud.key.
# To enable HTTP requests then make it
# SECURITY_MODE="--insecure"


# USERNAME  Sets username for server authentication (must contains the flag '-u' for Script to add the value)
# Default is kvmHaHelperDefaultUsername. If this is changed, the CloudStack global settings 'kvm.ha.webservice.username' should also be updated to match this configuration.
# USERNAME="-u kvmHaHelperDefaultUsername"

# KEYWORD  Sets the keyworkd / password for server authentication  (must contains the flag '-k' for Script to add the value)
# Default is kvmHaHelperDefaultPassword. If this is changed, the CloudStack global settings 'kvm.ha.webservice.password' should also be updated to match this configuration.
# KEYWORD="-k kvmHaHelperDefaultPassword"
