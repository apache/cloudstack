#
# This script builds Debian packages for CloudStack and does
# so by altering the debian/changelog file and add the Ubuntu
# version as a suffix, for example: 4.9.0~xenial
#
# To build packages for Ubuntu 14.04 run this script on a
# 14.04 system. The same goes for Ubuntu 16.04
#
# The biggest difference between those two versions is the
# sysvinit vs systemd and Java 7 vs Java 8
#
# These packages can be build using Docker for example:
#
# Assume that the cloudstack source is present in /tmp/cloudstack
#
# Ubuntu 16.04
# docker run -ti -v /tmp:/src ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y dpkg-dev python debhelper openjdk-8-jdk genisoimage python-mysql.connector maven lsb-release devscripts dh-systemd python-setuptools && /src/cloudstack/packaging/build-deb.sh"
#
# Ubuntu 14.04
# docker run -ti -v /tmp:/src ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y dpkg-dev python debhelper openjdk-8-jdk genisoimage python-mysql.connector maven lsb-release devscripts dh-systemd python-setuptools && /src/cloudstack/packaging/build-deb.sh"
