  <title>Automatic Snapshot Creation and Retention</title>
  <para>(Supported for the following hypervisors: <emphasis role="bold">XenServer</emphasis>,
      <emphasis role="bold">VMware vSphere</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold"
    >KVM</emphasis>)</para>
  <para>Users can set up a recurring snapshot policy to automatically create multiple snapshots of a
    disk at regular intervals. Snapshots can be created on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly
    interval. One snapshot policy can be set up per disk volume. For example, a user can set up a
    daily snapshot at 02:30.</para>
  <para>With each snapshot schedule, users can also specify the number of scheduled snapshots to be
    retained. Older snapshots that exceed the retention limit are automatically deleted. This
    user-defined limit must be equal to or lower than the global limit set by the &PRODUCT;
    administrator. See <xref linkend="globally-configured-limits"/>. The limit applies only to those
    snapshots that are taken as part of an automatic recurring snapshot policy. Additional manual
    snapshots can be created and retained.</para>
