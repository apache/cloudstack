  <title>Load Balancer Rules</title>
  <para>A &PRODUCT; user or administrator may create load balancing rules that balance traffic
    received at a public IP to one or more VMs. A user creates a rule, specifies an algorithm, and
    assigns the rule to a set of VMs.</para>
  <note>
    <para>If you create load balancing rules while using a network service offering that includes an
      external load balancer device such as NetScaler, and later change the network service offering
      to one that uses the &PRODUCT; virtual router, you must create a firewall rule on the virtual
      router for each of your existing load balancing rules so that they continue to
      function.</para>
