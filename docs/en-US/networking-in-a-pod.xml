	<title>Networking in a Pod</title>
	<para>The figure below illustrates network setup within a single pod. The hosts are connected to a
		pod-level switch. At a minimum, the hosts should have one physical uplink to each switch.
		Bonded NICs are supported as well. The pod-level switch is a pair of redundant gigabit
		switches with 10 G uplinks.</para>

	<para>Servers are connected as follows:</para>

	<listitem><para>Storage devices are connected to only the network that carries management traffic.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Hosts are connected to networks for both management traffic and public traffic. </para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Hosts are also connected to one or more networks carrying guest traffic.</para></listitem>

	<para>We recommend the use of multiple physical Ethernet cards to implement each network interface as well as redundant switch fabric in order to maximize throughput and improve reliability.</para>
