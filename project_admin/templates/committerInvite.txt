This is the invitation email, sent after a positive result 
from the vote for a new committer.

Don't send this until there has been 72 hours for a lazy consensus
on private@incubator.apache.org.

Don't forget we need to forward this mail to 
private@incubator.apache.org

Subject: invitation to become CloudStack committer: Joe Bloggs #####

Hello #####, the Apache CloudStack Podling Project Management Committee
would like to invite you to become a CloudStack committer. We value 
your contributions and are aware that you are committed to the project.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes and so
not need to go via the patch submission process. This should
enable you to be more productive. 

While this does not mean that you need to participate any more
than you already do, it does tend to make one even more committed.
Hence you will probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a developer,
contributing as you do now.

This personal email is also providing a chance for you to decline
in private. Either way, please let us know in reply only to the
cloudstack-private@incubator.apache.org list. If you agree, then we will announce
on the cloudstack-dev@ list after the account is established.

Yours,
The Apache CloudStack PPMC
