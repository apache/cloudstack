  <title>Assigning VLANs to Isolated Networks</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides you the ability to control VLAN assignment to Isolated networks. As a
    Root admin, you can assign a VLAN ID when a network is created, just the way it's done for
    Shared networks.</para>
  <para>The former behaviour also is supported &mdash; VLAN is randomly allocated to a network from
    the VNET range of the physical network when the network turns to Implemented state. The VLAN is
    released back to the VNET pool when the network shuts down as a part of the Network Garbage
    Collection. The VLAN can be re-used either by the same network when it is implemented again, or
    by any other network. On each subsequent implementation of a network, a new VLAN can be
    assigned.</para>
  <para>Only the Root admin can assign VLANs because the regular users or domain admin are not aware
    of the physical network topology. They cannot even view what VLAN is assigned to a
    network.</para>
  <para>To enable you to assign VLANs to Isolated networks,</para>

      <para>When VLAN is specified, a CIDR and gateway are assigned to this network and the state is
        changed to Setup. In this state, the network will not be garbage collected.</para>

  <note>
    <para>You cannot change a VLAN once it's assigned to the network. The VLAN remains with the
      network for its entire life cycle.</para>
