# Setting up Tools and Environment

    - Install VirtualBox 4.2 or latest
    - Tool for exporting appliances: qemu-img, vboxmanage, vhd-util
    - Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
    - Setup paths:
          export PATH=~/.rvm/bin:$PATH
    - Install Ruby 1.9.3, if it installed some other version:
          rvm install 1.9.3
    - Set rvm to use that 1.9.3
          rvm use ruby-1.9.3
    - Install bundler: (if you get any openssl issue see https://rvm.io/packages/openssl)
          gem install bundler

All the dependencies will be fetched automatically.

To save some time if you've downloaded iso of your distro, put the isos in:
tools/appliance/iso/

Note, gem may require gcc-4.2, make sure link exists:

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.2

# How to build SystemVMs automatically

Just run build.sh, it will export archived appliances for KVM, XenServer,
VMWare and HyperV in `dist`:

    sh build.sh [systemvmtemplate|systemvmtemplate64]

# Building SystemVM template appliance manually

List available appliances one can build:

    veewee vbox list

Modify scripts in definitions/*appliance*/ as per needs.
Build systemvm template appliance:

    veewee vbox build 'systemvmtemplate'

Start the box:

    veewee vbox up 'systemvmtemplate'

Halt the box:

    veewee vbox halt 'systemvmtemplate'

Now VirtualBox can be used to export appliance.

===============
If you see following line in the screen, then veewee is failing 
extracting vboxmanage version.

    Downloading vbox guest additions iso v  - http://download.virtualbox.org/vi

You would be able to check it manually by typing:

    vboxmanage --version

If you're using Fedora for example, you'll need to install `kernel-devel`
package and run `/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup` to get veewee working.
