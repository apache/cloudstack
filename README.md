![Apache CloudStack](tools/logo/apache_cloudstack.png)

Apache CloudStack is the open stack source software designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used
by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many
companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of a
hybrid cloud solution.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire "stack" of features
most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration,
Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API,
resource accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).

CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors:
VMware vSphere, KVM, XenServer, XenProject and Hyper-V as well as
OVM and LXC containers.

Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line
tools, and/or a full-featured query based API.

## Who Uses CloudStack?

* There are more than 150 known organizations using Apache CloudStack (or a commercial distribution of CloudStack). Our users include many major service providers running CloudStack to offer public cloud services, product vendors who incorporate or integrate with CloudStack in their own products, organizations who have used CloudStack to build their own private clouds, and systems integrators that offer CloudStack related services.

* See our [case studies](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies) highlighting successful deployments of Apache CloudStack.

* See the up-to-date list of current [users](https://cloudstack.apache.org/users.html).
