This is the email to end a vote for a new PPMC member.
We do this on the CloudStack Private mailing list as that 
is where the vote is held..

Remember that this also needs to be forwarded to 
private@incubator.apache.org and a 72 hour period for lazy 
consensus must follow before moving on to the next stage
(committerInvite.txt).

The vote passes, we now need lazy consensus approval from the IPMC. This email
calls for that consensus.
