example.ver.1 > example.ver.2:
  * VirtualRouters are now deployed with the latest version of ExampleLinux
    and wil also use a new MyFirstDHCPServer instead of dnsmasq to provide
    faster and more robust deployment of new Instances

  * ISOs are no longer supported and will be replaced by 2.88MB Floppy Drives
    which can now be attached to Instances. This is to prevent the Secondary
    Storage to grow to enormous sizes as Linux Distributions keep growing in
    size while a stripped down Linux should fit on a 2.88MB floppy.
