    <title>Uploading an Existing Volume to a Virtual Machine</title>
        <para>Existing data can be made accessible to a virtual machine. This is called uploading a volume to the VM. For example, this is useful to upload data from a local file system and attach it to a VM. Root administrators, domain administrators, and end users can all upload existing volumes to VMs.</para>
        <para>The upload is performed using HTTP. The uploaded volume is placed in the zone's secondary storage</para>
        <para>You cannot upload a volume if the preconfigured volume limit has already been reached. The default limit for the cloud is set in the global configuration parameter max.account.volumes, but administrators can also set per-domain limits that are different from the global default. See Setting Usage Limits </para>
