# Apache CloudStack

Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used
by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many
companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of a
hybrid cloud solution.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire "stack" of features
most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration,
Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API,
resource accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).

CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors:
VMware, KVM, XenServer, XenProject and Hyper-V.

Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line
tools, and/or a full-featured RESTful API. In addition, CloudStack provides an
API that's compatible with AWS EC2 and S3 for organizations that wish to deploy
hybrid clouds.

## Who Uses CloudStack?

There are more than 150 known organisations using Apache CloudStack (or a
commercial distribution of CloudStack). Our users include many major service
providers running CloudStack to offer public cloud services, product vendors who
incorporate or integrate with Cloudstack in their own products, organisations
who have used Cloudstack to build their own private clouds, and systems
integrators that offer CloudStack related services.
