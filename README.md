Apache CloudStack Version 4.2.0

# About Apache CloudStack

Apache CloudStack is software designed to deploy 
and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly 
available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used by a number of 
service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many 
companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering.

Apache CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors: 
VMware, Oracle VM, KVM, XenServer and Xen Cloud Platform. 
CloudStack also offers bare metal management of servers, 
using PXE to provision OS images and IPMI to manage the server. 
Apache CloudStack offers three methods for managing cloud 
computing environments: an easy to use Web interface, command 
line tools, and a full-featured RESTful API.
