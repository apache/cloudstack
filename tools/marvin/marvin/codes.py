@Desc     : This module defines all codes, constants maintained globally \
            and used across marvin and its test features.The main purpose \
            is to maintain readability, maintain one common place for \
            all codes used or reused across test features. It enhances \
            maintainability and readability. Users just import statement \
            to receive all the codes mentioned here. EX: Here, we define \
            a code viz., ENABLED  with value "Enabled",then using \
            this code in a sample feature say test_a.py as below. \

            from codes import *
            if obj.getvalue() == ENABLED
