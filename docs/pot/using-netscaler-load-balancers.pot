msgid "Citrix NetScaler is supported as an external network element for load balancing in zones that use advanced networking (also called advanced zones). Set up an external load balancer when you want to provide load balancing through means other than &PRODUCT;’s provided virtual router."

msgid "The functional behavior of the NetScaler with &PRODUCT; is the same as described in the &PRODUCT; documentation for using an F5 external load balancer. The only exception is that the F5 supports routing domains, and NetScaler does not. NetScaler can not yet be used as a firewall."
