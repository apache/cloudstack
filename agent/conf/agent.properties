# The java class which the agent loads to execute.
resource=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.LibvirtComputingResource

# The number of threads running in the agent.

# The IP address of the management server.
host=localhost

# The time interval (in seconds) after which agent will check if the connected host
# is the preferred host (the first host in the comma-separated list is the preferred
# one). After that interval, if the agent is connected to one of the secondary/backup hosts,
# it will attempt to reconnect to the preferred host.
# The timer task is scheduled after the	 agent connects to a management server.
# On connection, it receives admin configured
# cluster-level 'indirect.agent.lb.check.interval' setting that will be used by
# the agent as the preferred host check interval, however, if the following setting
# is defined it will override the received value. The value 0 and lb algorithm 'shuffle'

# This parameter sets the VM migration speed.

# ---------------- AGENT HOOKS -----------------
# Agent hooks is the way to override default agent behavior to extend the functionality without excessive coding
# for a custom deployment.
# There are 3 arguments needed for the hook to be called: the base directory (defined in agent.hooks.basedir),
# the name of the script that is located in the base directory (defined in agent.hooks.*.script)
# and the method that is going to be called on the script (defined in agent.hooks.*.method).
# These properties are detailed below.
# Hooks are implemented in Groovy and must be implemented in a way
# that keeps default CS behavior if something goes wrong.

# All hooks are located in a special directory defined in 'agent.hooks.basedir'.
# agent.hooks.basedir=/etc/cloudstack/agent/hooks

# Every hook has two major attributes - script name, specified in 'agent.hooks.*.script' and method name
# specified in 'agent.hooks.*.method'.

# Libvirt XML transformer hook does XML-to-XML transformation, which allows the provider to modify
# VM XML specification before is sent to libvirt.
# The provider can use this to add/remove/modify some sort of attributes in Libvirt XML domain specification.
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_xml_transformer.script=libvirt-vm-xml-transformer.groovy
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_xml_transformer.method=transform

# The hook is called right after libvirt successfully launched the VM.
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_on_start.script=libvirt-vm-state-change.groovy
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_on_start.method=onStart

# The hook is called right after libvirt successfully stopped the VM.
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_on_stop.script=libvirt-vm-state-change.groovy
#agent.hooks.libvirt_vm_on_stop.method=onStop

# Setting to enable the CPU model to KVM guest globally.
# Possible values: custom | host-model | host-passthrough
# - custom: user customs the CPU model, which is specified by property guest.cpu.model.
# - host-model: identifies the named CPU model which most closely matches the host,
# and then requests additional CPU flags to complete the match. This should give
# close to maximum functionality/performance, which maintains good
# reliability/compatibility if the guest is migrated to another host with slightly different host CPUs.
# - host-passthrough: tells KVM to passthrough the host CPU with no modifications.
# It is different from host-model because instead of just matching feature flags,
# every last detail of the host CPU is matched. This gives absolutely best performance,
# and can be important to some apps which check low level CPU details,
# but it comes at a cost with migration. The guest can only be migrated to
# an exactly matching host CPU.
# If null (default), libvirt defaults to custom
