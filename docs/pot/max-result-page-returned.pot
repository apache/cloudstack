msgid "For each cloud, there is a default upper limit on the number of results that any API command will return in a single page. This is to help prevent overloading the cloud servers and prevent DOS attacks. For example, if the page size limit is 500 and a command returns 10,000 results, the command will return 20 pages."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The default page size limit can be different for each cloud. It is set in the global configuration parameter default.page.size. If your cloud has many users with lots of VMs, you might need to increase the value of this parameter. At the same time, be careful not to set it so high that your site can be taken down by an enormous return from an API call. For more information about how to set global configuration parameters, see \"Describe Your Deployment\" in the Installation Guide."
