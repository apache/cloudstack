	<title>Firewall Rules</title>
	<para>By default, all incoming traffic to the public IP address is rejected by the firewall. To allow external traffic, you can open firewall ports by specifying firewall rules.  You can optionally specify one or more CIDRs to filter the source IPs. This is useful when you want to allow only incoming requests from certain IP addresses.</para>
	<para>You cannot use firewall rules to open ports for an elastic IP address. When elastic IP is used, outside access is instead controlled through the use of security groups. See <xref linkend="add-security-group"/>.</para>
	<para>Firewall rules can be created using the Firewall tab in the Management Server UI. This tab is not displayed by default when &PRODUCT; is installed. To display the Firewall tab, the &PRODUCT; administrator must set the global configuration parameter firewall.rule.ui.enabled to "true."</para>
