Zip32.dll is the original Info-Zip Zip 2.3 version (without encryption) that can be found on the Info-Zip sites:
   http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/
   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/  
   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip

unzip32.dll was compiled using the portable unzip550 source code that can be found on the Info-Zip sites:
   http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/
   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/  
   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip
The only thing that was modified is that the "crypt.c" and "crypt.h" files have been replaced with the dummy ones coming from the Zip 2.3 sources.
So this unzip32.dll does not contain any encryption/decryption code or binary.
