This is an ES6-modules-compatible version of
https://github.com/nodeca/pako, based on pako version 1.0.3.

It's more-or-less a direct translation of the original, with unused parts
removed, and the dynamic support for non-typed arrays removed (since ES6
modules don't work well with dynamic exports).
