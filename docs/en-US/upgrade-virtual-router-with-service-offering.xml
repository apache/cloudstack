    <title>Upgrading a Virtual Router with System Service Offerings</title>
    <para>When CloudPlatform creates a virtual router, it uses default settings which are defined in a default system service offering. See <xref linkend="system-service-offerings"/>. All the virtual routers in a single guest network use the same system service offering. You can upgrade the capabilities of the virtual router by creating and applying a custom system service offering.</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Define your custom system service offering. See <xref linkend="creating-system-service-offerings"/>. In System VM Type, choose Domain Router.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Associate the system service offering with a network offering. See <xref linkend="creating-network-offerings"/></para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>3.    Apply the network offering to the network where you want the virtual routers to use the new system service offering. If this is a new network, follow the steps in Adding an Additional Guest Network on page 66.
