   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            ANTLR 2 License
            
            We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An
            individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed
            with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR,
            or its output, into commercial software. We encourage users to develop software
            with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR.
            By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into
            one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
            you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
            etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please
            mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers
            remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we
            expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools
            available as they are completed.

            C. Any new file that is contributed or otherwise made
            available under the terms of this License.
            
            1.10. "Original Software" means the Source Code and
            Executable form of computer software code that is
            originally released under this License.
            
            1.11. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned
            or hereafter acquired, including without limitation,
            method, process, and apparatus claims, in any patent

            the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You"
            includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is
            under common control with You. For purposes of this
            definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or
            indirect, to cause the direction or management of such

            2. License Grants.
            
            2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
            
            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, the
            Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
            royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,
            to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
            sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or
            portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
            and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using or selling of Original Software, to make, have
            made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or
            otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or
            portions thereof).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software
            available to a third party under the terms of this
            License.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from
            the Original Software, or (2) for infringements
            caused by: (i) the modification of the Original
            Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original
            Software with other software or devices.
            
            2.2. Contributor Grant.
            
            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
            Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to
            use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
            and distribute the Modifications created by such
            Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
            unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
            Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using, or selling of Modifications made by that
            Contributor either alone and/or in combination with
            its Contributor Version (or portions of such
            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
            have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
            Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
            thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications
            made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version
            (or portions of such combination).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and
            2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications
            available to a third party.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor
            has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
            infringements caused by: (i) third party
            modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the
            combination of Modifications made by that Contributor
            with other software (except as part of the
            Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under
            Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
            absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
            
            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, the
            Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
            royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,
            to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
            sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or
            portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
            and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using or selling of Original Software, to make, have
            made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or
            otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or
            portions thereof).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software
            available to a third party under the terms of this
            License.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from
            the Original Software, or (2) for infringements
            caused by: (i) the modification of the Original
            Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original

            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, each

            non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than

            use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
            and distribute the Modifications created by such
            Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an

            Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using, or selling of Modifications made by that
            Contributor either alone and/or in combination with
            its Contributor Version (or portions of such
            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
            have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
            Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
            thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications
            made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version
            (or portions of such combination).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and
            2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications
            available to a third party.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor
            has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
            infringements caused by: (i) third party
            modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the
            combination of Modifications made by that Contributor
            with other software (except as part of the
            Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under
            Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
            absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software

            have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
            Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
            thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications

            infringements caused by: (i) third party

            Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the

            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)
            
            THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
            LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
            CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
            
            1. DEFINITIONS
            
            "Contribution means:
            
            a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
            distributed under this Agreement, and
            
            b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
            
            i) changes to the Program, and
            
            ii) additions to the Program;
            
            where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
            distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
            acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
            the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
            conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
            derivative works of the Program.
            
            "Contributor means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
            
            "Licensed Patents  mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
            "necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
            "combined with the Program.
            
            "Program means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
            
            "Recipient means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
            "all Contributors.
            
            2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
            
            a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
            distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.
            
            b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
            Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
            Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
            This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
            Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
            addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
            Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
            which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
            
            c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
            its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
            Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
            property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
            intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
            rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
            responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
            For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
            distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
            before distributing the Program.
            
            d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
            rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
            this Agreement.
            
            3. REQUIREMENTS
            
            A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
            own license agreement, provided that:
            
            a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
            
            b) its license agreement:
            
            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
            conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
            non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
            fitness for a particular purpose;
            
            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
            damages, such as lost profits;
            
            iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
            that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
            
            iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
            and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
            medium customarily used for software exchange.
            
            When the Program is made available in source code form:
            
            a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
            
            b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
            
            Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
            Program.
            
            Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
            any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
            originator of the Contribution.
            
            4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
            
            Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
            respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
            intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
            includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
            which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
            a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
            Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
            every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
            and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
            actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
            extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
            connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
            offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
            to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
            Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
            control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
            related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
            any such claim at its own expense.
            
            For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
            offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
            Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
            related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
            Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
            Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
            Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
            requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.
            
            5. NO WARRANTY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
            "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
            Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
            distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
            rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
            program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
            programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
            
            6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
            CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
            PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
            STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
            OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            
            7. GENERAL
            
            If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
            law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
            terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
            provision valid and enforceable.
            
            If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
            a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
            lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
            under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
            addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
            itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
            infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
            Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
            
            All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
            comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
            not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
            such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
            Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
            reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
            and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
            survive.
            
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
            order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
            modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
            publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
            No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
            IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
            as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
            Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
            Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
            under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
            is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
            Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
            2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
            intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
            expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
            expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
            
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
            intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
            Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
            after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
            any resulting litigation.

                 substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
                 Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
                 Modification is:
                      A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
                      containing Original Code or previous Modifications.
            
                      B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or

                 License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.
            
                 1.10.1. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or
                 hereafter acquired, including without limitation,  method, process,

                 compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code
                 differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
                 well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
                 Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the

                 For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is
                 controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of
                 this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect,
                 to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
                 contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
                 (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such
                 entity.

                 non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
                 claims:
                      (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                      trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
                      modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
                      Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
                      as part of a Larger Work; and
            
                      (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
                      selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
                      sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
                      Original Code (or portions thereof).
            
                      (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
                      effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
                      Original Code under the terms of this License.
            
                      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
                      granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
                      separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
                      by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
                      combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
            
                 2.2. Contributor Grant.
                 Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
                 hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
            
                      (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                      trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
                      display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
                      created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
                      unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
                      and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
                      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
                      selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
                      and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
                      of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
                      made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
                      Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
                      Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
                      Version (or portions of such combination).
            
                      (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
                      effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
                      the Covered Code.
            
                      (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                      granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
                      Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
                      3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
                      Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
                      by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
                      Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
                      infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
                      that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
                 3.1. Application of License.
                 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
                 governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
                 Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
                 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
                 of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
                 copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
                 distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
                 version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
                 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
                 an additional document offering the additional rights described in
                 Section 3.5.
            
                 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
                 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
                 made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
                 either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
                 Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
                 Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                 months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
                 (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
                 has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
                 ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
                 Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
            
                 3.3. Description of Modifications.
                 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
                 file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
                 the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
                 the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
                 Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
                 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
                 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
            
                 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
                      (a) Third Party Claims.
                      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
                      intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
                      granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                      Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
                      distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
                      party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
                      know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
                      the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                      Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
                      Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                      (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                      reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
                      Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
            
                      (b) Contributor APIs.
                      If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
                      interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
                      are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                      also include this information in the LEGAL file.
            
                           (c)    Representations.
                      Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
                      Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
                      Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
                      Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
                      this License.
            
                 3.5. Required Notices.
                 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
                 Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
                 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
                 to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
                 You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                 Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                 for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
                 rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
                 charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
                 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
                 any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
                 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                 Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
                 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
                 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
                 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
                 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
                 the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
                 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
                 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                 collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
                 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
                 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
                 Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
                 rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
                 License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                 from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                 Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
                 terms You offer.
            
                 3.7. Larger Works.
                 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
                 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
                 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
                 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
            
            4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            
                 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
                 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
                 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
                 be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
                 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
                 understand it.
            
            5. Application of this License.
            
                 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
                 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
            
            6. Versions of the License.
            
                 6.1. New Versions.
                 Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
                 and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
                 will be given a distinguishing version number.
            
                 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
                 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
                 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
                 version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
                 of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
                 other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
                 Covered Code created under this License.
            
                 6.3. Derivative Works.
                 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
                 only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
                 governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
                 the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
                 "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
                 license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
                 and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
                 Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
                 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
                 Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
                 this License.)
            
            7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
                 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
                 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
                 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
                 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
                 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
                 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
                 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
                 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
                 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
                 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
            
            8. TERMINATION.
            
                 8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
                 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
                 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
                 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
                 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
                 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
                 shall survive.
            
                 8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
                 claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
                 or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
                 You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
            
                 (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
                 infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
                 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
                 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
                 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
                 agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
                 royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
                 Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
                 the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
                 of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
                 is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
                 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
                 the 60 day notice period specified above.
            
                 (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
                 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
                 any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
                 and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
                 sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                 Participant.
            
                 8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
                 alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
                 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
                 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
                 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
                 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
                 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
                 license.
            
                 8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
                 all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
                 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
                 prior to termination shall survive termination.
            
            9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
                 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
                 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
                 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
                 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
                 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
                 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
                 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
                 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
                 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
                 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
                 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
                 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
                 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
                 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            
            10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
                 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
                 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
                 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
                 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
                 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
                 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
                 rights set forth herein.
            
            11. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
                 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
                 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                 necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
                 California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
                 any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
                 With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
                 or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
                 States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
                 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
                 District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
                 California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
                 without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
                 expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
                 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
                 Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
                 shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
                 License.
            
            12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
                 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
                 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
                 out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
                 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
                 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
                 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
            
            13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
            
                 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
                 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
                 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
                 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
                 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

                      Original Code (or portions thereof).
            
                      (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are

                      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is

                      separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
                      by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
                      combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
            
                 2.2. Contributor Grant.
                 Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
                 hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
            
                      (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
                      trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
                      display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
                      created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
                      unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
                      and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
                      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
                      selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
                      and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
                      of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
                      made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
                      Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
                      Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
                      Version (or portions of such combination).
            
                      (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
                      effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
                      the Covered Code.
            
                      (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
                      granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
                      Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
                      3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
                      Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
                      by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
                      Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
                      infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
                      that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
                 3.1. Application of License.
                 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
                 governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
                 Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
                 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
                 of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
                 copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
                 distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
                 version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
                 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
                 an additional document offering the additional rights described in
                 Section 3.5.
            
                 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
                 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
                 made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
                 either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
                 Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
                 Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
                 Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
                 months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
                 (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
                 has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
                 ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
                 Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
            
                 3.3. Description of Modifications.
                 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
                 file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
                 the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
                 the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
                 Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
                 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
                 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
            
                 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
                      (a) Third Party Claims.
                      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
                      intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
                      granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
                      Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
                      distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
                      party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
                      know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
                      the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
                      Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
                      Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
                      (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                      reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
                      Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
            
                      (b) Contributor APIs.
                      If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
                      interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
                      are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
                      also include this information in the LEGAL file.
            
                           (c)    Representations.
                      Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
                      Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
                      Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
                      Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
                      this License.
            
                 3.5. Required Notices.
                 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
                 Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
                 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
                 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
                 to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
                 You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                 Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
                 for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
                 rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
                 charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
                 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
                 any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
                 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
                 Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
                 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
                 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
                 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
                 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
                 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
                 the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
                 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
                 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
                 collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
                 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
                 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
                 Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
                 rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
                 License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
                 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
                 from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                 Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
                 terms You offer.
            
                 3.7. Larger Works.
                 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
                 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
                 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
                 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
            
            4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
            
                 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
                 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
                 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
                 be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
                 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
                 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
                 understand it.
            
            5. Application of this License.
            
                 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
                 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
            
            6. Versions of the License.
            
                 6.1. New Versions.
                 Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
                 and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
                 will be given a distinguishing version number.
            
                 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
                 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
                 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
                 version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
                 of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
                 other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
                 Covered Code created under this License.
            
                 6.3. Derivative Works.
                 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
                 only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
                 governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
                 the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
                 "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
                 license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
                 and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
                 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
                 Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
                 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
                 Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
                 this License.)
            
            7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
                 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
                 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
                 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
                 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
                 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
                 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
                 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
                 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
                 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
                 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
            
            8. TERMINATION.
            
                 8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
                 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
                 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
                 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
                 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
                 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
                 shall survive.
            
                 8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
                 claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
                 or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
                 You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
            
                 (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
                 infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
                 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
                 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
                 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
                 agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
                 royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
                 Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
                 the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
                 of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
                 is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
                 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
                 the 60 day notice period specified above.
            
                 (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
                 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
                 any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
                 and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
                 sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                 Participant.
            
                 8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
                 alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
                 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
                 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
                 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
                 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
                 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
                 license.
            
                 8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
                 all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
                 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
                 prior to termination shall survive termination.
            
            9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
                 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
                 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
                 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
                 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
                 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
                 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
                 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
                 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
                 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
                 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
                 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
                 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
                 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
                 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            
            10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
                 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
                 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
                 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
                 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
                 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
                 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
                 rights set forth herein.
            
            11. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
                 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
                 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                 necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
                 California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
                 any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
                 With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
                 or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
                 States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
                 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
                 District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
                 California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
                 without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
                 expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
                 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
                 Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
                 shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
                 License.
            
            12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
                 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
                 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
                 out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
                 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
                 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
                 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
            
            13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
            
                 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
                 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
                 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
                 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
                 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
            
            EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.

            portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
            and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software
            available to a third party under the terms of this
            License.

            Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using, or selling of Modifications made by that

            Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
            absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, the
            Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
            royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,

            portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
            and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using or selling of Original Software, to make, have
            made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or
            otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software
            available to a third party under the terms of this
            License.

            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            Copyright (c) IBM Corp 2006 
            
            Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)
            
            THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
            LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
            CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
            
            1. DEFINITIONS
            
            "Contribution means:
            
            a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
            distributed under this Agreement, and
            
            b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
            
            i) changes to the Program, and
            
            ii) additions to the Program;
            
            where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
            distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
            acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
            the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
            conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
            derivative works of the Program.
            
            "Contributor means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
            
            "Licensed Patents  mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
            "necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
            "combined with the Program.
            
            "Program means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
            
            "Recipient means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
            "all Contributors.
            
            2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
            
            a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
            distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.
            
            b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
            Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
            Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
            This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
            Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
            addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
            Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
            which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
            
            c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
            its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
            Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
            property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
            intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
            rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
            responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
            For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
            distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
            before distributing the Program.
            
            d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
            rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
            this Agreement.
            
            3. REQUIREMENTS
            
            A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
            own license agreement, provided that:
            
            a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
            
            b) its license agreement:
            
            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
            conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
            non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
            fitness for a particular purpose;
            
            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
            damages, such as lost profits;
            
            iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
            that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
            
            iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
            and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
            medium customarily used for software exchange.
            
            When the Program is made available in source code form:
            
            a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
            
            b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
            
            Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
            Program.
            
            Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
            any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
            originator of the Contribution.
            
            4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
            
            Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
            respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
            intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
            includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
            which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
            a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
            Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
            every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
            and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
            actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
            extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
            connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
            offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
            to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
            Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
            control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
            related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
            any such claim at its own expense.
            
            For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
            offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
            Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
            related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
            Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
            Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
            Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
            requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.
            
            5. NO WARRANTY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
            "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
            Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
            distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
            rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
            program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
            programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
            
            6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
            CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
            PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
            STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
            OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            
            7. GENERAL
            
            If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
            law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
            terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
            provision valid and enforceable.
            
            If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
            a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
            lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
            under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
            addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
            itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
            infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
            Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
            
            All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
            comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
            not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
            such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
            Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
            reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
            and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
            survive.
            
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
            order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
            modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
            publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
            No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
            IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
            as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
            Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
            Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
            under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
            is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
            Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
            2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
            intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
            expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
            expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
            
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
            intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
            Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
            after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
            any resulting litigation.

            Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)
            
            THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
            LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
            CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
            
            1. DEFINITIONS
            
            "Contribution means:
            
            a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
            distributed under this Agreement, and
            
            b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
            
            i) changes to the Program, and
            
            ii) additions to the Program;
            
            where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
            distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
            acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
            the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
            conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
            derivative works of the Program.
            
            "Contributor means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
            
            "Licensed Patents  mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
            "necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
            "combined with the Program.
            
            "Program means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
            
            "Recipient means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
            "all Contributors.
            
            2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
            
            a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
            reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
            distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.
            
            b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
            Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
            Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
            Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
            This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
            Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
            addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
            Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
            which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
            
            c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
            its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
            Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
            property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
            intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
            rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
            responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
            For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
            distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
            before distributing the Program.
            
            d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
            rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
            this Agreement.
            
            3. REQUIREMENTS
            
            A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
            own license agreement, provided that:
            
            a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
            
            b) its license agreement:
            
            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
            conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
            non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
            fitness for a particular purpose;
            
            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
            damages, such as lost profits;
            
            iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
            that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
            
            iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
            and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
            medium customarily used for software exchange.
            
            When the Program is made available in source code form:
            
            a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
            
            b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
            
            Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
            Program.
            
            Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
            any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
            originator of the Contribution.
            
            4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
            
            Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
            respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
            intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
            includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
            which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
            a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
            Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
            every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
            and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
            actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
            extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
            connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
            offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
            relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
            to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
            Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
            control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
            related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
            any such claim at its own expense.
            
            For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
            offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
            Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
            related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
            Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
            Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
            Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
            requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
            Contributor must pay those damages.
            
            5. NO WARRANTY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
            "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
            NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
            Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
            distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
            rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
            program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
            programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
            
            6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
            
            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
            CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
            PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
            STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
            OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
            GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            
            7. GENERAL
            
            If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
            law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
            terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
            provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
            provision valid and enforceable.
            
            If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
            a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
            lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
            under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
            addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
            itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
            infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
            Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
            
            All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
            comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
            not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
            such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
            Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
            reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
            and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
            survive.
            
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
            order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
            modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
            publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
            No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
            IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
            as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
            Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
            Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
            under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
            is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
            Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
            2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
            intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
            expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
            expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
            
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
            intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
            Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
            after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
            any resulting litigation.
